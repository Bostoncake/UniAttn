Blood samples were collected from participants (men, n=10; age: 24.4\u00b12.93 years) 15, 0 min before the start of exercise, and 30, 45, 60 min after a cycle ergometer exercise at 75 W for 15 min. Also heart rate (HR), galvanic skin response (GSR), and rectal temperature were monitored. The exercise induced a significant increase (p<0.01) in plasmatic orexin A with a peak at 30 min after the exercise bout, in association with an increase of the other three monitored variables: HR (p<0.01), GSR (p<0.05), and rectal temperature (p<0.01).",

It is not directly related to the patient's symptoms of recurrent respiratory infections, crackles in the lungs, or the cardiac findings of a murmur and diastolic rumble. Therefore, thrombocytosis is not the most likely development if left untreated.\n\nOption B: Secondary hypertension:\nSecondary hypertension refers to high blood pressure that is caused by an underlying medical condition. While the patient's cardiac findings could potentially be related to hypertension, there is no specific mention of high blood pressure in the patient's history. Additionally, there is no information provided to suggest an underlying cause of secondary hypertension. Therefore, secondary hypertension is not the most likely development if left untreated.\n\nOption C: Aortic dissection:\nAortic dissection is a serious condition in which there is a tear in the wall of the aorta, the main artery that carries blood from the heart to the rest of the body. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings (recurrent respiratory infections, crackles in the lungs, grade 3/6 holosystolic murmur, diastolic rumble) do not specifically suggest aortic dissection. Therefore, aortic dissection is not the most likely development if left untreated.\n\nOption D: Digital clubbing:\nDigital clubbing refers to the swelling of the fingertips or toes, resulting in an enlargement and rounding of the nails. While the patient's current symptoms and physical examination findings do not directly suggest digital clubbing, it can be associated with chronic respiratory conditions. The patient's history of recurrent respiratory infections and crackles in the lungs may suggest an underlying chronic respiratory condition, which could lead to the development of digital clubbing if left untreated. Therefore, digital clubbing is the most likely development if left untreated.\n###Answer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.",

The response to nociceptive injury in diabetes differs from that seen in normal individuals in that diabetic patients have increased susceptibility to infections and recover slowly or incompletely from infections and tissue injury due to an abnormal inflammatory response. We have chosen to examine the effect of STZ-induced hypoinsulinemia on the hyperalgesia associated with the enhanced inflammatory state that is induced by the subcutaneous injection of CFA to delineate the potential role of insulin in the development of chronic pain. STZ- and vehicle-treated Sprague-Dawley rats were tested using thermal and mechanical stimulation after subcutaneous injection of CFA. The behavioral response was compared with that similarly determined in non-diabetic controls and insulin-depleted rats that received insulin replacement. Recovery of the thermal hyperalgesic response to baseline levels occurred over a period of 9-14 days, but the allodynic response to mechanical stimulation persisted for the duration of the study in STZ-treated rats. Insulin replacement prevented the delay in recovery of mechanical allodynia, but had no obvious effect on nociception in uninflamed tissue.",

Bmi-1 controls cell cycle and self-renewal of tissue stem cells, transcription factor c-myc affects cell proliferation and apoptosis, and Snail regulates epithelial-mesenchymal transition. The expression of these markers has been connected to prognosis in many cancer types. Bmi-1, c-myc, and Snail expressions were studied in our material consisting of 73 primarily T1N0M0 oral tongue carcinoma patients. We compared the immunoexpressions of Bmi-1, c-myc, and Snail with clinical parameters including the degree of histological differentiation, tumour size, TNM classification, depth of invasion, and resection margins. In addition, survival analyses were performed, comparing disease-free survival time with the registered protein expression of the markers mentioned above. A significant correlation between Bmi-1 protein expression and recurrence (log-rank test, P=0.005) was detected. Snail and c-myc expression did not correlate with prognosis.

The influence on bone metabolism with altered bone resorption is the most studied clinical condition in PHPT. In addition to this, patients with PHPT are at increased risk of non-skeletal diseases, such as impaired insulin sensitivity, arterial hypertension and increased risk of death by cardiovascular diseases (CVD), possibly mediated by a chronic low-grade inflammation. The aim of this study was to investigate whether adipose tissue reflects the low-grade inflammation observed in PHPT patients. Subcutaneous fat tissue from the neck was sampled from 16 non-obese patients with PHPT and from 16 patients operated for benign thyroid diseases, serving as weight-matched controls. RNA was extracted and global gene expression was analysed with Illumina BeadArray Technology. We found 608 differentially expressed genes (q-value<0.05), of which 347 were up-regulated and 261 were down-regulated. Gene ontology analysis showed that PHPT patients expressed increased levels of genes involved in immunity and defense (e.g. matrix metallopeptidase 9, S100 calcium binding protein A8 and A9, CD14, folate receptor 2), and reduced levels of genes involved in metabolic processes. Analysis of transcription factor binding sites present in the differentially expressed genes corroborated the up-regulation of inflammatory processes.",

The purpose of this study was to identify protein targets for the sHsp alphaB-crystallin in lens cell homogenates during conditions of mild thermal stress. The authors report the use of a fusion protein, maltose-binding protein alphaB-crystallin (MBP-alphaB), immobilized on amylose resin as a novel method for isolating endogenous alphaB-crystallin-binding proteins from lens cell homogenates after mild thermal stress. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and western immunoblot analyses showed selective interactions in lens cell homogenates between MBP-alphaB and endogenous alphaA- and alphaB-crystallins, the lens-specific intermediate filament proteins phakinin (CP49) and filensin (CP115), and vimentin during a mild 20-minute heat shock at 45 degrees C. No interactions were observed with the beta- or gamma-crystallins, or the cytoskeletal proteins actin, alpha-tubulin, and spectrin, although these proteins were present in lens cell homogenates. In contrast, gamma-crystallin and actin interacted with MBP-alphaB at 45 degrees C only in their purified states. The results obtained with MBP-alphaB were confirmed by immunoprecipitation reactions in which immunoprecipitation of native bovine alphaB-crystallin from heat-shocked lens cell homogenates resulted in the coprecipitation of phakinin and filensin.",

We hypothesize that this method will offer key insights into how the usability of the NIS not only impacts use but also informs redesign opportunities. In addition, this is one of the few rigorous studies of NIS and provides direction and recommendations for informaticians, developers and nurse decision makers.\n\n###Answer: yes",

Considering the role of nurses in healthcare, it is shocking that there is a lack of evaluations of nursing information systems in the literature. Here we report on how a human factors approach can be used to address barriers and facilitators to use of the nursing information system (NIS). Human factors engineering (HFE) approaches provide the theoretical and methodological underpinning to address these socio-technical issues. This study investigated the use of an NIS, a module of the electronic health record (EHR) previously implemented throughout the hospital system. The study took place in two hospitals (760 beds and 300 beds) within a three-hospital health system. Earlier in the year, the NIS was implemented throughout the health system. We applied a scenario-based evaluation technique in order to understand the barriers and facilitators to nurse use of the NIS as part of improving the healthcare delivery system. The scenarios were designed to have the nurses interact with the major components of the NIS. The research team developed the standardized scenarios to cover the major functions of the system. Twelve nurses completed the study and results show that documentation within the NIS was hindered by several aspects of the interface. This paper discusses the themes associated with the usability of the NIS interface analyzing them using usability heuristics. The team also identified facilitators to use and proposed avenues to support or enhance these facilitators.",

Hence, a large number of candidate genes are involved in stroke pathophysiology, such as blood pressure regulation and atherosclerosis. Although angiotensin-converting enzyme insertion/deletion (ACE I/D) polymorphism is considered to have a role in hypertension, coronary artery disease, and myocardial infarction, its relationship with cerebrovascular disease and hypertension in stroke in different ethnic populations is still inconsistent. ACE I/D polymorphism, detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), was studied in 97 patients with large-vessel and 60 patients with small-vessel atherosclerotic stroke (44 asymptomatic, 16 symptomatic lacunes) and 85 healthy subjects with normal brain imaging. The demographic data, lipid profile and risk factors of patients and controls were obtained retrospectively. ACE genotypes were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in both patients and controls. Prevalences of DD, ID and II genotype were 41%, 40%, and 19%, respectively, in the stroke group. Differences in ACE I/D polymorphism distribution were statistically insignificant between the groups. This lack of association between stroke and ACE I/D polymorphism did not change in the presence of traditional risk factors (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, smoking, and dyslipidemia). Although hypertension was significantly more common in the patient groups, ACE I/D polymorphism showed no effect on hypertension risk.

To assess whether low-dose tryptophan depletion can tease out the psychological mechanisms sensitive to substrate depletion in vulnerable subjects without inducing mood changes, a between-subjects randomized design was used. Recovered depressed patients (n = 24) and healthy volunteers (n = 24) were administered while fasting either a tryptophan-free or a control mixture, containing 31.2 and 33.2 g of amino acids, respectively.

Although the primary cause of death in Ewing sarcoma is metastasis, the mechanism underlying tumor spread needs to be elucidated. To this end, the role of the CXCR4/SDF-1a chemokine axis as a mediator of Ewing sarcoma metastasis was investigated. CXCR4 expression status was measured in primary tumor specimens by immunohistochemical staining and in multiple cell lines by quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR and flow cytometry. Migration and invasion of CXCR4-positive Ewing sarcoma cells toward CXCL12/SDF-1a were also determined. Interestingly, while CXCR4 status was disparate among Ewing sarcoma cells, ranging from absent to high-level expression, its expression was found to be highly dynamic and responsive to changes in the microenvironment. In particular, upregulation of CXCR4 occurred in cells that were subjected to growth factor deprivation, hypoxia, and space constraints. This upregulation of CXCR4 was rapidly reversed upon removal of the offending cellular stress conditions. Functionally, CXCR4-positive cells migrated and invaded toward an SDF-1a gradient and these aggressive properties were impeded by both the CXCR4 small-molecule inhibitor AMD3100, and by knockdown of CXCR4. In addition, CXCR4-dependent migration and invasion were inhibited by small-molecule inhibitors of Cdc42 and Rac1, mechanistically implicating these Rho-GTPases as downstream mediators of the CXCR4-dependent phenotype.",

Pulsus paradoxus is measured by noting the difference between the systolic pressure at which the Korotkoff sounds are first heard (during expiration) and the systolic pressure at which the Korotkoff sounds are heard with each heabeat, independent of the respiratory phase. Between these two pressures, the Korotkoff sounds are heard only intermittently and during expiration. The cuff pressure must be decreased slowly to appreciate the finding. It can be difficult to measure pulsus paradoxus in patients with tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, or tachypnea. A pulsus paradoxus may be palpable at the brachial aery or femoral aery level when the pressure difference exceeds 15 mmHg. This inspiratory fall in systolic pressure is an exaggerated consequence of interventricular dependence. ref: Harrison&;s principle of internal medicine,20th edition,pg no.1824.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.",

Mild brain temperature modulations are known to affect the outcome of ischemia dramatically. This study examined changes of extracellular lactate during and after global cerebral ischemia, in which intraischemic brain temperature was held at either 30 degrees C, 37 degrees C, or 39 degrees C. Halothane-anesthetized fasted male Wistar rats underwent 20 minutes of global cerebral ischemia produced by bilateral carotid artery occlusions plus systemic hypotension (40 to 50 mm Hg). Rectal temperature was maintained at 37 degrees C throughout, and intraischemic brain temperature was held at either 30 degrees C (n = 6), 37 degrees C (n = 5), or 39 degrees C (n = 5). Before and after the ischemic insult, brain temperature was maintained at 37 degrees C in all groups. A microdialysis cannula was implanted in the right dorsolateral striatum and perfused with Ringer's solution. Dialysate samples were collected at 10-minute intervals before, during, and after ischemia and were analyzed for lactate by enzymatic-fluorometric techniques. In all groups, extracellular lactate rose during ischemia and peaked at 10 to 30 minutes of recirculation. Maximal extracellular lactate elevations were sevenfold, eightfold, and eightfold above control in the 30 degrees C, 37 degrees C, 39 degrees C groups, respectively. Significant elevations with respect to control were observed in all groups at 10 to 30 minutes of recirculation. In the 30 degrees C group, these elevations above control were also significant at the 10- and 20-minute ischemic time points (P = .001). At 30 minutes of recirculation, however, lactate levels were lower in the 30 degrees C rats than in the other groups.",

Paul's Clinical Anesthesia/Pg. 671)The Mapleson E is a modification of Ayre's T-piece, which was developed in 1937 by Phillip Avre for use in paediatric patients undergoing cleft palate repair or intracranial surgery.ConstructionA three-way T-tube whose limbs are connected to (F) the fresh gas supply from the anaesthesia machine, (R) a length of corrugated reservoir tube and (P) the patient connector. It has minimal dead space, no valves and minimal resistance.Function:Inspiration - The patient inspires fresh gas from the reservoir tube.Expiration - The patient expires into the reservoir tube. Although fresh gas is still flowing into the system at this time, it is wasted, as it is contaminated by expired gas. An expiratory limb volume greater than the patient's tidal volume prevents entrainment of room air (which would dilute anaesthetic gases and oxygen).Expiratory pause - Fresh gas washes the expired gas out of the reservoir tube, filling it with fresh gas for the next inspiration.A fresh gas flow greater than three times the minute ventilation prevents rebreathing.Spontaneous ventilationThe fresh gas and exhaled gas flow down the expiratory limb. Peak expiratory flow occurs early in exhalation. Thus, the proportion of fresh gas added to the exhaled gases increases. During the next breath, fresh gas is drawn from the fresh gas inlet and the expiratory limb.The original analysis of the Mapleson E system suggested that a gas flow rate of 2.5 to 3 times the minute volume was required to prevent rebreathing of expired gas. However, this assumed a square-wave respiratory pattern, and investigations using a more realistic breathing pattern have suggested that 1.5-2 times the minute volume is acceptable in spontaneously breathing patients:Body weight (kg)Fresh gas flow (L/min)51.4-1.8102.4-3.2204.1-5.4407.2-9.6Controlled ventilationIn contrast to Mapleson A systems, Mapleson D and E circuits are more efficient during controlled than spontaneous ventilation. This is because the tidal volume must be supplied during the expiratory pause. With the almost sinusoidal respiratory pattern of spontaneous respiration, there is relatively little time for this volume to be supplied, so the fresh gas flow rate must be high. The pattern of controlled ventilation, however, is usually one of a rapid inspiration, expiration and a relatively prolonged expiratory pause. This long expiratory pause gives ample time for the tidal volume requirement to be supplied, even with a fairly low fresh gas flow rate. Consequently, during controlled ventilation, the recommended fresh gas flow rate is similar to that of the Mapleson A systems during spontaneous ventilation.Intermittent positive pressure ventilation may be performed by intermittently occluding the end of the reservoir tube.\n\n###Answer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.",

However, the pathogenetic role of PVL in staphylococcal infections remains controversial, possibly because it depends on the site of infection. We compared the course of experimental rabbit osteomyelitis due to the PVL-positive CA-MRSA strain USA 300 (LAC) and its PVL-negative isogenic derivative (LACDeltapvl), using a low and a high inoculum (8x10(5) and 4x10(8) CFU). With the low inoculum, bone infection was less frequent on day 7 (D7) and day 28 (D28) with LACDeltapvl than with LAC (respectively 12/19 and 18/19 animals, p = 0.042). With the high inoculum of both strains, all the animals were infected on D7 and the infection persisted on D28 in almost every case. However, tibial bacterial counts and the serum CRP concentration fell significantly between D7 and D28 with LACDeltapvl but not with LAC. Respectively 67% and 60% of LAC-infected rabbits had bone deformation and muscle/joint involvement on D7, compared to 0% and 7% of LACDeltapvl-infected rabbits (p = 0.001 and p = 0.005 respectively).

However, information on the behaviour of dominant NORs is very sparse and needed for an integrative knowledge of differential gene transcription levels and chromatin specific domain interactions. Using molecular and cytological approaches in a wheat-rye addition line (wheat genome plus the rye nucleolar chromosome pair 1R), we investigated transcriptional activity and chromatin topology of the wheat dominant NORs in a nucleolar dominance situation. Herein we report dominant NORs up-regulation in the addition line through quantitative real-time PCR and silver-staining technique. Accompanying this modification in wheat rDNA trascription level, we also disclose that perinucleolar knobs of ribosomal chromatin are almost transcriptionally silent due to the residual detection of BrUTP incorporation in these domains, contrary to the marked labelling of intranucleolar condensed rDNA. Further, by comparative confocal analysis of nuclei probed to wheat and rye NORs, we found that in the wheat-rye addition line there is a significant decrease in the number of wheat-origin perinucleolar rDNA knobs, corresponding to a diminution of the rDNA heterochromatic fraction of the dominant (wheat) NORs.",

However, the mechanisms underlying TNF-\u03b1-induced cPLA2 expression in human lung epithelial cells (HPAEpiCs) were not completely understood. We demonstrated that TNF-\u03b1 induced cPLA2 mRNA and protein expression, promoter activity, and PGE2 secretion in HPAEpiCs. These responses induced by TNF-\u03b1 were inhibited by pretreatment with the inhibitor of MEK1/2 (PD98059), p38 MAPK (SB202190), JNK1/2 (SP600125), or AP-1 (Tanshinone IIA) and transfection with siRNA of TNFR1, p42, p38, JNK2, c-Jun, c-Fos, or ATF2. We showed that TNF-\u03b1 markedly stimulated p42/p44 MAPK, p38 MAPK, and JNK1/2 phosphorylation which were attenuated by their respective inhibitors.

Furthermore, TNF-\u03b1-induced cPLA2 promoter activity was abrogated by transfection with the point-mutated AP-1 cPLA2 construct. Finally, we showed that TNF-\u03b1 time-dependently induced p300/c-Fos/c-Jun/ATF2 complex formation in HPAEpiCs. On the other hand, TNF-\u03b1 induced in vivo binding of c-Jun, c-Fos, ATF2, and p300 to the cPLA2 promoter in these cells.

These benign growths histologically show hyperplasia of the epidermis. While cosmetically disturbing to some patients, the primary medical concern is that, occasionally, seborrheic keratoses may mimic the clinical appearance of basal cell carcinomas or squamous cell carcinomas. Consequently, biopsy should be performed on atypical appearing or rapidly changing \"seborrheic keratoses\" to exclude the presence of cancer.

This decrease was mainly due to changes in the standardized incidence of hip fracture in institution-dwelling women. A decrease in age-adjusted hip fracture incidence has been recently demonstrated in some countries. Since a large proportion of hip fractures occur in nursing homes, we analyzed whether this decreasing trend would be more detectable in institution-dwelling elderly compared with community-dwelling elderly. All hip fracture patients aged 60 years and over were identified in a well-defined area. Incidence of hip fracture, age- and sex-adjusted to the 2000 Geneva population, was computed in community- and institution-dwelling elderly. From 1991 to 2000, 1,624 (41%) hip fractures were recorded in institutionalized-dwelling elderly and 2,327 (59%) in community-dwelling elderly.

Physiological and pathological factors have been shown to influence the %fPSA value and diagnostic accuracy. To evaluate genetic determinants of %fPSA, we conducted a genome-wide association study of serum %fPSA by genotyping 642,584 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 3192 men of European ancestry, each with a tPSA level of 2.5 to 10 ng/ml, that were recruited in the REduction by DUtasteride of Prostate Cancer Events study. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with P < 10(-5) were further evaluated among the controls of a population-based case-control study in Sweden (2899 prostate cancer cases and 1722 male controls), including 464 controls having tPSA levels of 2.5 to 10 ng/ml. We identified two loci that were associated with %fPSA at a genome-wide significance level (P <5 x 10(-8)). The first associated SNP was rs3213764 (P = 6.45 x 10(-10)), a nonsynonymous variant (K530R) in the ATF7IP gene at 12p13. This variant was also nominally associated with tPSA (P = .015).

The major treatment challenge is patients with refractory epilepsy. Whereas neurologists typically focus on seizure reduction in the treatment of these patients, results of studies relating seizure frequency to QOL are conflicting. As depression is associated with reduced QOL in epilepsy and antiepileptic medications (AEDs) can cause depression, it is important to determine the relative roles of depression and seizure frequency in QOL in refractory epilepsy. Prospective evaluation was conducted of patients with refractory epilepsy being admitted to an inpatient video-EEG monitoring unit. The impact of clinical variables (age, sex, marital status, seizure frequency, duration and type of seizure disorder, seizure localization, number of AEDs, depression) on QOL was analyzed. Depression was a powerful predictor of QOL (n = 122, beta = -35.8, p < 0.0001). No other variable predicted QOL.

The authors tested the effect of a right hand movement that electrically stimulated left hand contraction on right motor cortex excitability. Three tasks were used in 15 healthy subjects--a motor and stimulation task (MS(task)), stimulation only task (S(task)), and motor only task (M(task)). The MS(task) consisted of isometric thumb abduction of the right hand that triggered paired electrical stimulation of the left abductor pollicis brevis (APB) and first dorsal interosseus (FDI) motor points. The S(task) was performed 1 week later and matched the stimulation received in the MS(task). The M(task) was performed as a control. Transcranial magnetic stimulation applied to the right motor cortex assessed corticospinal excitability, short latency intracortical inhibition, and intracortical facilitation of the FDI and APB before, immediately after, and 30 minutes after task performance. Corticospinal excitability increased in the FDI and APB following the MS(task) but not following the S(task) or M(task).

This bi-directional effect of stress is not understood at the functional level. Here we tested the hypothesis that pre-stress level of adaptive thermogenesis and brown adipose tissue (BAT) functions explain the vulnerability or resilience to stress-induced obesity. We used wt and triple \u03b21,\u03b22,\u03b23-Adrenergic Receptors knockout (\u03b2-less) mice exposed to a model of chronic subordination stress (CSS) at either room temperature (22\u00a0\u00b0C) or murine thermoneutrality (30\u00a0\u00b0C). A combined behavioral, physiological, molecular, and immunohistochemical analysis was conducted to determine stress-induced modulation of energy balance and BAT structure and function. Immortalized brown adipocytes were used for in\u00a0vitro assays. Departing from our initial observation that \u03b2ARs are dispensable for cold-induced BAT browning, we demonstrated that under physiological conditions promoting low adaptive thermogenesis and BAT activity (e.g. thermoneutrality or genetic deletion of the \u03b2ARs), exposure to CSS acted as a stimulus for BAT activation and thermogenesis, resulting in resistance to diet-induced obesity despite the presence of hyperphagia. Conversely, in wt mice acclimatized to room temperature, and therefore characterized by sustained BAT function, exposure to CSS increased vulnerability to obesity. Exposure to CSS enhanced the sympathetic innervation of BAT in wt acclimatized to thermoneutrality and in \u03b2-less mice. Despite increased sympathetic innervation suggesting adrenergic-mediated browning, norepinephrine did not promote browning in \u03b2ARs knockout brown adipocytes, which led us to identify an alternative sympathetic/brown adipocytes purinergic pathway in the BAT. This pathway is downregulated under conditions of low adaptive thermogenesis requirements, is induced by stress, and elicits activation of UCP1 in wt and \u03b2-less brown adipocytes. Importantly, this purinergic pathway is conserved in human BAT.",

Low yields from the natural host and expression problems in heterologous hosts have limited the potential applications of pernisine in industry. The challenges of pernisine overexpression in Escherichia coli were overcome by codon preference optimisation and de-novo DNA synthesis. The following forms of the pernisine gene were cloned into the pMCSGx series of vectors and expressed in E. coli cells: wild-type (pernisinewt), codon-optimised (pernisineco), and codon-optimised with a S355A mutation of a predicted active site (pernisineS355Aco). The fusion-tagged pernisines were purified using fast protein liquid chromatography equipped with Ni2+ chelate and gel filtration chromatography columns. The identities of the resultant proteins were confirmed with N-terminal sequencing, tandem mass spectrometry analysis, and immunodetection. Pernisinewt was not expressed in E. coli at detectable levels, while pernisineco and pernisineS355Aco were expressed and purified as 55-kDa proforms with yields of around 10 mg per litre E. coli culture. After heat activation of purified pernisine, the proteolytic activity of the mature pernisineco was confirmed using zymography, at a molecular weight of 36 kDa, while the mutant pernisineS355Aco remained inactive.

Albuterol is a beta-2 adrenergic agonist, which means it activates the beta-2 adrenergic receptors and leads to relaxation of smooth muscles, including bronchial and cardiac muscles. Therefore, Albuterol is not likely to produce a response similar to drug B, as it would be expected to increase contraction rather than decrease it.\n\nOption B: Propranolol:\nPropranolol is a non-selective beta-adrenergic antagonist, also known as a beta-blocker. It blocks the beta-adrenergic receptors, which would lead to a decrease in the effects of adrenaline and other beta-receptor agonists.

Stem cell therapy focused on improving cardiac function is a promising approach for treating heart disease. Here, we evaluated the therapeutic effects of cardiac mesenchymal stem cells (CMSCs) in a mouse model of chronic Chagas disease. CMSCs were isolated from green fluorescent protein (GFP) transgenic C57BL/6 mouse hearts and tested for adipogenic, osteogenic, chondrogenic, endothelial, and cardiogenic differentiation potentials evaluated by histochemical and immunofluorescence techniques. A lymphoproliferation assay was performed to evaluate the immunomodulatory activity of CMSCs. To investigate the therapeutic potential of CMSCs, C57BL/6 mice chronically infected with Trypanosoma cruzi were treated with 106 CMSCs or saline (control) by echocardiography-guided injection into the left ventricle wall. All animals were submitted to cardiac histopathological and immunofluorescence analysis in heart sections from chagasic mice. Analysis by quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed in the heart to evaluate the expression of cytokines involved in the inflammatory response.

Moreover, these cells expressed endothelial cell and cardiomyocyte features upon defined stimulation culture conditions and displayed immunosuppressive activity in vitro. After intramyocardial injection, GFP+ CMSCs were observed in heart sections of chagasic mice one week later; however, no observed GFP+ cells co-expressed troponin T or connexin-43. Histopathological analysis revealed that CMSC-treated mice had a significantly decreased number of inflammatory cells, but no reduction in fibrotic area, two months after treatment.

The cellular response to radiation injury in the intestine or bone marrow can be modulated by agents given before irradiation. Lipopolysaccharide is known to be radioprotective in the bone marrow, but its effect on the intestine is not known. We sought to determine if lipopolysaccharide is radioprotective in the intestine and, if so, to determine the mechanism of its radioprotective effects. Mice were treated with parenteral lipopolysaccharide or vehicle and then irradiated (14 Gy total body irradiation in a cesium irradiator). The number of surviving intestinal crypts was assessed 3.5 days after irradiation using a clonogenic assay. Parenteral administration of lipopolysaccharide 2-24 hours before irradiation resulted in a 2-fold increase in the number of surviving crypts 3.5 days after irradiation. The radioprotective effects of lipopolysaccharide could be eliminated by coadministration of a selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase 2. Lipopolysaccharide was radioprotective in wild-type mice but not in mice with a disrupted cyclooxygenase 2. Parenteral administration of lipopolysaccharide resulted in increased production of prostaglandins in the intestine and in the induction of cyclooxygenase 2 expression in subepithelial fibroblasts and in villous, but not crypt, epithelial cells.",

These two strands are always complementary in sequence. One strand serves as a template for the formation of the other during DNA replication, a major source of inheritance. This unique feature of DNA provides a mechanism for the continuity of life. The structure of DNA was found by Rosalind Franklin when she used x-ray crystallography to study the genetic material. The x-ray photo she obtained revealed the physical structure of DNA as a helix. DNA has a double helix structure. The outer edges are formed by alternating deoxyribose sugar molecules and phosphate groups, which make up the sugar-phosphate backbone. The two strands run in opposite directions, one going in a 3' to 5' direction and the other going in a 5' to 3' direction.

        "input": "###Question: Do a theoretical model for input impedance of interstitial microwave antennas with choke?\n###Context: Two important characteristics for interstitial microwave antennas used in clinical hyperthermia are: (1) a good impedance match to minimize reflected power; and (2) a good power deposition pattern which is independent of insertion depth. A major problem of the miniature coaxial dipole antennas used for interstitial hyperthermia is the fact that the impedance and power deposition patterns of these antennas change with insertion depth. One possible solution is the addition of a coaxial choke. A theoretical model for calculating the input impedance of interstitial microwave antennas having a coaxial choke is presented, which may serve as the first step in the design of such antennas. A theoretical model for calculating the input impedance of coaxial microwave antennas with and without a choke is presented using insulated antenna theory. The theoretical model was used to calculate the input impedance of several prototype antennas having various choke and feedline dimensions, and comparison was made with experimentally measured impedance measurements in tissue-equivalent phantom. The choke section of the antenna is not ideal if conventional plastic insulation is used as the choke dielectric, because the desired radiating length of the antenna is significantly shorter than the quarter-wavelength in the choke dielectric. Impedance calculations based on the theoretical model correlate reasonably well with experimentally measured impedance. Based on these calculations, the effect of parameters such as choke layer thickness and choke dielectric constant are discussed for a 915 MHz antenna with choke.",

        "input": "###Question: Is hepcidin down-regulated in alcohol loading?\n###Context: It is common for alcoholic patients to have excess iron accumulation in the liver, which may contribute to the development of alcoholic liver disease (ALD). However, the mechanism of hepatic iron uptake in ALD is still obscure. Recently, a novel iron-regulatory hormone hepcidin was found that suppresses the absorption of iron from the small intestine and the release of iron from macrophages. To elucidate the contribution of hepcidin toward the hepatic excess iron accumulation in ALD, we examined whether alcohol loading affects hepcidin expression both in ALD patients and in an ethanol-fed mouse model. Serum prohepcidin concentration was quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Hepatic hepcidin-1 and hepcidin-2 mRNA expressions in mouse liver were evaluated by quantitative real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction method. The protein expression of prohepcidin in mouse liver was examined immunohistochemically by rabbit antimouse prohepcidin antibody. Serum prohepcidin concentration in ALD was significantly lower than that in healthy subjects (p<0.001). Especially, serum prohepcidin concentrations were decreased in the patients whose serum ferritin value was high. In the ethanol-fed mouse model, hepatic hepcidin-1 mRNA expression was significantly lower than that in control (p=0.04). Prohepcidin was expressed in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes of mice liver tissue sections, and its expression was decreased after ethanol loading.",

Here we investigated, for the first time, inhibitory molecules in HIV-2 infection, a naturally occurring attenuated form of HIV disease, associated with reduced viremia and very slow rates of CD4 T-cell decline. Programmed death (PD)-1/PD-L1, an important pathway in limiting immunopathology, and its possible relationship with T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing molecule-3 (TIM-3), a recently identified inhibitory molecule, were studied in untreated HIV-2 and HIV-1 cohorts, matched for degree of CD4 T-cell depletion, and noninfected individuals. Flow cytometric analysis of T-cell expression of PD-1, PD-L1 and TIM-3, combined with markers of cell differentiation, activation, cycling and survival. Statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA, Mann-Whitney/Wilcoxon tests, Spearman's correlations, multiple linear regressions and canonical correlation analysis. T-cell expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 was tightly associated and directly correlated with CD4 T-cell depletion and immune activation in HIV-2 infection. No such correlation was found for PD-L1 expression in HIV-1-positive patients. Central memory and intermediate memory cells, rather than terminally differentiated T-cells, expressed the highest levels of both PD-1 and PD-L1 molecules. Conversely, TIM-3 expression was independent of T-cell differentiation and dissociated from cell cycling, suggesting distinct induction mechanisms.

Microemulsions were prepared as physically stable oil/water systems. Previous work by this group has shown that microemulsions are highly effective antimembrane agents that result in rapid losses of viability in planktonic populations of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. In this experiment a microemulsion preparation was used upon established biofilm cultures of Ps. aeruginosa PA01 for a period of 4 h. The planktonic MIC of sodium pyrithione and the planktonic and biofilm MICs of cetrimide were used as positive controls and a biofilm was exposed to a volume of normal sterile saline as a treatment (negative) control. Results indicate three log-cycle reductions in viability within the microemulsion treated biofilm, as compared to those observed in control treatments of similar biofilms (one log-cycle reduction in viabilities).",

In this study, we examined the association between safety culture and quality measures in primary care offices. A total of 24 primary care offices in Cleveland, Ohio. The Medical Office Survey on Patient Safety was administered to clinicians and support staff to rate 12 dimensions of safety culture and a single overall patient safety rating.

However, recent swine and canine studies have not demonstrated stunning-dependent cTnI degradation. To address the universality of cTnI modification, myocardial biopsy samples were obtained from coronary artery bypass patients (n=37) before and 10 minutes after removal of cross-clamp. Analysis of biopsy samples for cTnI by Western blotting revealed a spectrum of modified cTnI products in myocardium both before and after cross-clamp, including degradation products (7 products resulting from differential N- and C-terminal processing) and covalent complexes (3 products). In particular, a 22-kDa cTnI degradation product with C-terminal proteolysis was identified, which may represent an initial ischemia-dependent cTnI modification, similar to cTnI(1-193) observed in stunned rat myocardium. Although no systematic change in amount of modified cTnI was observed, subgroups of patients displayed an increase (n=10, 85+/-5% of cTnI remaining intact before cross-clamp versus 75+/-5% after) or a decrease (n=12, 67+/-5% before versus 78+/-5% after). Electron microscopy demonstrated normal ultrastructure in biopsy samples, which suggests no necrosis was present.

All subjects underwent clinical and laboratory evaluations and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) to assess LV diastolic function and stiffness of the descending thoracic aorta using the pressure-strain elastic modulus (PSEM). To validate results using PSEM, aortic strain, stiffness, and distensibility were assessed. Patients as compared with controls had higher PSEM (8.14\u2009\u00b1\u20094.25 vs 5.97\u2009\u00b1\u20092.31 U, P < 0.001) and had lower mitral inflow E/A and septal and lateral mitral annulus tissue Doppler E'/A' velocity ratios, longer isovolumic relaxation time, lower septal and lateral mitral annulus E' velocities, and higher mitral E/septal E' and mitral E/lateral E' velocity ratios (all P \u2264 0.03), all indicative of LV diastolic dysfunction.

The Injury Severity Score (ISS) has been criticized for underrepresenting and inaccurately defining mechanical injury. The influence of pelvic injury volume on organ dysfunction and multiple organ failure (MOF) has not been described. Through the use of CT, this investigation sought to precisely define volumes of mechanical tissue damage by anatomic region and examine its impact on organ failure. (1) Do patients with MOF have a greater volume of pelvic and retroperitoneal tissue damage when compared with those without MOF? (2) In patients who sustained pelvic trauma, does the magnitude of pelvic injury differ in patients with MOF? (3) Does the magnitude of organ dysfunction correlate with pelvic tissue damage volume? Seventy-four multiply injured patients aged 18 to 65 years with an ISS \u2265 18 admitted to the intensive care unit for a minimum of 6 days with complete admission CT scans were analyzed. Each identifiable injury in the head/neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis underwent volumetric determination using CT to generate regional tissue damage volume scores. Primary outcomes were the development of MOF as measured by the Denver MOF score and the degree of organ dysfunction by utilization of the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score. Mean pelvic and retroperitoneal tissue damage volumes were compared in patients who developed MOF and those who did not develop MOF using Student's t-test. Among patients who sustained pelvic injuries, we compared mean volume of tissue damaged in patients who developed MOF and those who did not. We assessed whether there was a correlation between organ dysfunction, as measured by the SOFA score as a continuous variable, and the volume of pelvic and retroperitoneal tissue damage using the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient. The average volume of tissue damage was greater in patients with MOF when compared with those without (MOF: 685.667 \u00b1 1081.344; non-MOF: 195.511 \u00b1 381.436; mean difference 490.156 cc [95% confidence interval {CI}, 50.076-930.237 cc], p = 0.030). Among patients who sustained pelvic injuries, those with MOF had higher average tissue damage volumes than those without MOF (MOF: 1322.000 \u00b1 1197.050; non-MOF: 382.750 \u00b1 465.005; mean difference 939.250 [95% CI, 229.267-1649.233], p = 0.013).

Although the cyclin E level is amplified, and overexpressed, in many cancers, including colorectal cancer, the role of low molecular weight cyclin E in colorectal cancer remains to be studied. Therefore, the expression of low molecular weight cyclin E in various stages of colorectal tumors was studied. The expression of low molecular weight cyclin E was analyzed in 45 tumors, and compared with paired normal mucosa from the same patients (6 adenomas, 11 stage A, 14 stage B and 14 stage C colorectal cancers) by Western blot analysis. The expres sion of low molecular weight cyclin E was also analyzed in normal colon mucosa from 12 healthy normal controls. The low molecular weight cyclin E was expressed exclusively in all stages of colon tumors, but not in the normal mucosa from the same patients or in the normal controls.

Mathematical modelling of drug delivery and cellular responsiveness based on underutilised DCE-MRI data has the unique potential to predict therapeutic responsiveness for individual patients. To interpret DCE-MRI data, we created a modelling framework that operates over multiple time and length scales and incorporates intracellular metabolism, nutrient and drug diffusion, trans-vascular permeability, and angiogenesis. The computational methodology was used to analyse DCE-MR images collected from eight breast cancer patients at Baystate Medical Center in Springfield, MA. Computer simulations showed that trans-vascular transport was correlated with tumour aggressiveness because increased vessel growth and permeability provided more nutrients for cell proliferation. Model simulations also indicate that vessel density minimally affects tissue growth and drug response, and nutrient availability promotes growth. Finally, the simulations indicate that increased transport heterogeneity is coupled with increased tumour growth and poor drug response.",

This potentiation also was observed at synapses formed by pairs of monosynaptically connected neurons. It was dependent on N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, occluded classic long-term potentiation, and could be depotentiated by low-frequency stimulation at 3 Hz.

        "output": "###Rationale: LDL ???? Elevated LDL cholesterol and decreased HDL cholesterol are independent predictors of coronary hea disease. - Although there is consensus regarding the benefits of lowering LDL cholesterol the value of elevating HDL cholesterol remains controversial. Low HDL and coronary risk High serum HDL cholesterol is associated with a lower risk of CHD. The incidence of CHD events in a normal population appears to be inversely related to serum HDL cholesterol with low levels being associated with increased coronary risk. - Based upon data .from the Framingham Hea study, the risk for myocardial infarction increases by about 25%.for every 5mg/d1 (.13 nuno1/1) decrement in serum HDL cholesterol. Elevated LDL and coronary risk Elevation in LDL cholesterol is a well known risk factor for the development of coronary aery disease. Association of elevated LDL with coronary aery disease has been established in various trials and studies. There is linear reduction in cardiovascular disease with progressive lowering of the LDL cholesterol. Traditionally LDL levels are considered to be the nzost impoant factor in the prediction of coronary aery disease. The impoance of LDL as a risk factor lies in the fact that effective therapes are avalaible to lower it, while it is not so in the case of HDL. So when treating dyslipidemia for reducing cardiovascular events, the .first target is LDL and not HDL. Doubt and Controversy What is creating doubts in our mind is a table from Braunwald 8th/e p1008 according to which 'Low HDL' appears to be better marker, for prediction of future cardiovascular disease than 'High LDL'. According to this bar diagram in Braunnwald 8\"Ye p1008 - the adjusted hazard ratio .for .future cardiovascular events for LDL is 1.62 while that of HDL is 2.32. But the text given in the book does clarify which one is better marker. (we have give this table from Braunwald in our previous discussion on this topic in Nov 2009 Medicine). We have tried to confirm this low HDL' fact from various other books. But none of the texts clearly. ored any one between these 2 to be the better marker. Both LDL and HDL are mentioned to be impoant. We have also consulted several cardiologist on this. All of them say that the answer should be LDL Well, Braunwald is text book of immense reputation. and any information or text given in the book does not need confirmation from any other source. But what has added to the confusion is that the latest edition of Braunwald i.e., 9\"/e has eliminated that diagram from the book and in the text have not clarified which one is better marker. Instead, the text states that Apolipo (a) and B 100 are better marker, .for predicting future cardiovascular events than LDL and HDL. We are not absolutely sure of the answer, but we would for the time being go with LDL. Also Know The following lipid and lipoprotein abnormalities are associated with increased coronary risk. - Elevated total cholesterol - Elevated LDL cholesterol Low HDL cholesterol - Increased total to HDL cholesterol ratio - Increased non HDL cholesterol - Hyperiglyceridemia - Increased Lp(a) - Increased apolipoprotein B - Sinai! dense LDL paicles\n\n###Answer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.",

The RAW264.7 macrophages were treated with LPS in the presence or absence of albiflorin, paeoniflorin, or paeonol. Global mRNA expression levels were detected by using an oligonucleotide microarray platform covering the mouse whole genome. Treatment with LPS caused expression level changes in 1,270 genes by 2 folds or more. Paeonol attenuated the induction level of 355 LPS-responsive genes. Classification of the genes targeted by paeonol according to the Panther group analysis revealed 20 biological processes, 24 molecular functions, and 22 signaling pathways. The Panther signaling pathways highly affected by paeonol included the 'inflammation mediated by chemokine and cytokine signaling', 'interleukin signaling', and 'Toll receptor signaling'.",

Therapies that activate the apoptotic cascade may have potential for use in RA; however, few therapeutic agents fit this category. The purpose of this study was to examine the potential of Bim, an agent that mimics the action of Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3) domain-only proteins that have shown success in preclinical studies of cancer, in the treatment of autoimmune disease. Synovial tissues from RA and osteoarthritis patients were analyzed for the expression of Bim and CD68 using immunohistochemistry. Macrophages from Bim(-/-) mice were examined for their response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) using flow cytometry, real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and immunoblotting. Bim(-/-) mice were stimulated with thioglycollate or LPS and examined for macrophage activation and cytokine production. Experimental arthritis was induced using the K/BxN serum-transfer model. A mimetic peptide corresponding to the BH3 domain of Bim (TAT-BH3) was administered as a prophylactic agent and as a therapeutic agent. Edema of the ankles and histopathologic analysis of ankle tissue sections were used to determine the severity of arthritis, its cellular composition, and the degree of apoptosis. The expression of Bim was reduced in RA synovial tissue as compared with controls, particularly in macrophages. Bim(-/-) macrophages displayed elevated expression of markers of inflammation and secreted more interleukin-1beta following stimulation with LPS or thioglycollate. TAT-BH3 ameliorated arthritis development, reduced the number of myeloid cells in the joint, and enhanced apoptosis without inducing cytotoxicity.",

We report two mutations associated with TBG-CD found in patients from Andrews, S.C., USA (TBG-CD-Andrews), and Berlin, Germany (TBG-CD-Berlin). Automated chemiluminescence immunoassays were used for the determination of TSH, free and total T4 and T3 (fT4, TT4, TT3) and TBG. Direct DNA sequencing was used to identify the TBG mutations in the propositi. TBG-CD-Andrews was found in a 1-month-old boy who was euthyroid with normal TSH and fT4, but reduced TT4, indicating TBG deficiency. TBG was not detectable, confirming TBG-CD. No mutation in the coding region and the promoter of the TBG gene was found, but a single nucleotide substitution in intron 1 disrupts the donor splice site of exon 0 (IVS1+2T>C).

It is known that the S1P transporter (Spns2) functions in extra-embryonic YSL to activate G protein-coupled receptor (S1pr2) signaling in endoderm for deposition of positional cues (integrin, fibronectin, etc.). Such cues are recognized by overlying lateral precardiac mesoderm that migrates to the midline and fuses to form the primordial heart tube. However, the source of bio-active S1P is not known. There are multiple receptors and it is not known if there are earlier or even receptor-independent functions for S1P. Because S1P can only be generated by sphingosine kinases, we targeted a mutation to the single kinase gene expressed during early embryogenesis (sphk2). Zygotic mutants survive to adulthood and appear normal, but maternal-zygotic mutant embryos phenocopy null zygotic mutants of spns2 or s1pr2.",

        "input": "###Question: Does urodynamic testing predict long-term urological complications following simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation?\n###Context: Combined pancreas-kidney transplantation is the treatment of choice for patients with type I diabetes mellitus associated with chronic renal failure. The introduction of the bladder drainage technique constituted a marked improvement of the surgical technique with a reduction of life-threatening complications. However, drainage of pancreatic secretions via the urinary bladder causes urological complications leading, in some cases, to cystoenteric conversion. We retrospectively analysed whether pre-operative urodynamic findings may predict the subsequent development of urological complications and influence the choice of exocrine secretion drainage. From 1987 to 1997, 39 bladder-drained simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantations were performed in 16 men and 23 women with a mean age of 38.5 yr. All patients underwent a complete urological assessment prior to surgery, including medical history, physical examination, urethrocystography and urodynamic assessment. Twenty-eight patients are alive with a mean follow-up of 62 +/- 8 months. In 60% of cases, both kidney and pancreas remain functional. Seven patients experienced recurrent lower urinary tract infections. Six patients suffered from chemical urethritis (four men and two women) and six suffered from recurrent haematuria (blood transfusions were required in two patients). One patient had incrusted stones at the site of duodenal staples. Urological complications were mostly observed in the 22 patients (79%) with abnormal urodynamic characteristics (Relative risk: 5.1). Intravenous Somatostatin failed to definitively cure these complications in most cases. Seven patients (17%) (five with urethritis, two with haematuria) required cystoenteric conversion. Two patients developed post-operative ileal fistula, one cutaneous and one into the bladder. All urinary symptoms resolved in these seven patients.",

Our earlier studies have shown that a 30\u00a0mg/kg dose of doxycycline can significantly impact the strength of polypropylene (PP) mesh in a rat hernia repair model at 6 and 12\u00a0weeks. The objective of the present study was to investigate the dose dependence of doxycycline treatment on hernia repair strengths in rats. Fifty-six Sprague-Dawley rats underwent hernia repair with either PP mesh (n\u00a0=\u00a028) or sutures only (primary; n\u00a0=\u00a028); both groups were further divided into four doxycycline groups of seven animals each: control (0\u00a0mg/kg), low (3\u00a0mg/kg), medium (10\u00a0mg/kg), and high (30\u00a0mg/kg). One day before hernia repair surgery, animals received doxycycline doses by gavage and continued receiving daily until euthanasia. After 8\u00a0weeks, rats were euthanized and tissue samples from hernia repaired area were collected and analyzed for tensile strength using a tensiometer (Instron, Canton, MA, USA), while MMPs 2, 3, and 9, and collagen type 1 and 3 were analyzed by western blotting. In mesh-repaired animals, medium and high doxycycline dose repaired mesh fascia interface (MFI) showed significant increase in tensile strength when compared to control. In the primary repaired animals, there was no significant difference in MFI tensile strength in any dose group. In medium-dose MFI, there was a significant reduction in MMPs 2, 3, and 9. In this animal group, MFI showed significant increase in collagen 1 and significant reduction in collagen type 3 when compared to control.",

However, the episode of elevated mood and increased energy in the past suggests a possible bipolar disorder rather than major depressive disorder.\n\nOption B: Schizoaffective disorder:\nSchizoaffective disorder is characterized by a combination of symptoms of schizophrenia, such as hallucinations or delusions, and symptoms of a mood disorder, such as depression or mania. There is no mention of hallucinations or delusions in this patient's history, so schizoaffective disorder is not a likely diagnosis.\n\nOption C: Bipolar disorder, type II:\nThis patient's history suggests a possible bipolar disorder due to the presence of both depressive and manic symptoms. The episode of elevated mood, increased energy, distractibility, and 'brilliant ideas' in the past is consistent with a hypomanic episode seen in bipolar disorder, type II. The current presentation of depressive symptoms further supports the diagnosis of bipolar disorder, type II.\n\nOption D: Bipolar disorder, type I:\nBipolar disorder, type I, is characterized by the presence of at least one manic episode, which is an episode of elevated mood, increased energy, and potentially psychotic symptoms. This patient's history, although suggestive of a previous hypomanic episode, does not provide enough evidence to meet the criteria for a manic episode.

Here, we studied the putative connection between NRF2 and the canonical WNT pathway, which modulates hepatocyte metabolism. WNT-3A increased the levels of NRF2 and its transcriptional signature in mouse hepatocytes and HEK293T cells. The use of short interfering RNAs in hepatocytes and mouse embryonic fibroblasts which are deficient in the redox sensor Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1) indicated that WNT-3A activates NRF2 in a \u03b2-Catenin- and KEAP1-independent manner. WNT-3A stabilized NRF2 by preventing its GSK-3-dependent phosphorylation and subsequent SCF/\u03b2-TrCP-dependent ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Axin1 and NRF2 were physically associated in a protein complex that was regulated by WNT-3A, involving the central region of Axin1 and the Neh4/Neh5 domains of NRF2. Axin1 knockdown increased NRF2 protein levels, while Axin1 stabilization with Tankyrase inhibitors blocked WNT/NRF2 signaling. The relevance of this novel pathway was assessed in mice with a conditional deletion of Axin1 in the liver, which showed upregulation of the NRF2 signature in hepatocytes and disruption of liver zonation of antioxidant metabolism. NRF2 takes part in a protein complex with Axin1 that is regulated by the canonical WNT pathway. This new WNT-NRF2 axis controls the antioxidant metabolism of hepatocytes.",

Prospective, observational, clinical study. University tertiary care hospital. Ninety-four children <10 years of age undergoing elective cardiac surgery requiring cardiopulmonary bypass surgery. The attending anesthesiologist assessed air-leak pressure after intubation in the operating room (OR). In addition, the air-leak test was performed in 42 patients before extubation in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). The incidence of adverse events and the number of failed extubations were recorded after removal of the ETT. Eleven of the 94 patients were excluded from the study. Four (4.3%) of the patients died in the PICU before extubation, and 7 patients were excluded for other reasons. The median age of the 83 children was 0.9 years (range 0.01-9.6 years).

Recent studies have suggested that TET can reduce the inflammatory response in microglia, but the mechanisms remain unclear. The aim of this study is to investigate whether TET can inhibit lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced microglial activation and clarify its possible mechanisms. Cell viability assays and cell apoptosis assays were used to determine the working concentrations of TET. Then, BV2 cells were seeded and pretreated with TET for 2 h.

The precise mechanisms remain incompletely understood. A new mouse model of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis was used to investigate the contribution of mast cells and trigeminal ganglia activation to conjunctival (conj.) inflammation after nasal allergen provocation. Sensitized mice were exposed to ovalbumin (OVA) via the nose and/or conjunctiva, and conj. homogenates were analyzed for histamine and substance P (using ELISA) and by eosinophil peroxidase (EPO) and beta-hexosaminidase assays. The conj. effects of nasal allergen deposition were compared with those induced by the mast cell activator C48/80 and with pretreatment of the mast cell stabilizer ketotifen or the transient receptor potential channel receptor (TRP) agonist capsaicin. Protachykinin 1 (TAC1) expression was quantified in the trigeminal ganglia using real time polymerase chain reaction. At 1 hour after nasal application of OVA, increased conj. levels of beta-hexosaminidase (0.68 \u00b1 0.03 nm versus 0.56 \u00b1 0.02 nm; p = 0.02), histamine (751.1 \u00b1 52.17 ng/mL versus 546.3 \u00b1 76.91 ng/mL; p = 0.05), and EPO (0.66 \u00b1 0.09 nm versus 0.37 \u00b1 0.03 nm; p = 0.02) were detected compared with saline. Higher levels of TAC1 expression were found in the trigeminal ganglia at 24 hours after OVA application (1326 \u00b1 255 versus 687.5 \u00b1 90.77 TAC1/beta-actin; p = 0.04). Nasal challenge with C48/80 increased substance P and beta-hexosaminidase levels in the conjunctiva, as well as TAC1 expression. Pretreatment with ketotifen resulted in lower levels of substance P as well as TAC1 expression.

This modeling approach was used to gain novel insight into the mechanisms by which oral AHA affects BW. Twenty-four hour glucose profiles were used to predict UGE before and after treatment with oral AHA. Model-predicted changes in BW due to reduced UGE were compared with reported changes in BW to quantify non-UGE-dependent effects (fluid retention, food intake, and energy expenditure). In type 2 diabetes patients [hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) >7.3%], the energy lost to UGE is predicted to decrease an average of 100 kcal/day for each 1% decrease in HbA1c. This effect, alone, is predicted to increase BW 1.4 kg after 6 months. Differences from this value reported for changes in BW with oral AHA therapy (+1.4 kg for pioglitazone and rosiglitazone; -0.4 kg for glyburide; -0.9 kg for sitagliptin and vildagliptin; -2.3 kg for metformin) are therefore predicted to be due to additional, non-UGE-dependent mechanisms.",

We investigated the prognostic value of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1alpha) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and its correlations with inflammation, angiogenesis and MYC oncogene. In a random series of 110 HCC patients, the mRNA of HIF-1alpha, inflammation related factors (COX-2, MMP7 and MMP9), angiogenesis related factors (VEGF and PDGFRA) and MYC in tumor tissue were detected by real-time RT-PCR and HIF-1alpha protein was assessed by immunohistochemistry. The correlations between HIF-1alpha mRNA and the factors mentioned previously, the relationship between HIF-1alpha and clinicopathologic features, and the prognostic value were analyzed. The expression of both HIF-1alpha mRNA and protein in HCC were independent prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) (P = 0.012 and P = 0.021, respectively) and disease-free survival (DFS) (P = 0.004 and P = 0.007, respectively) as well.

Here we investigated whether pESCs could repair myocardial infarction (MI), in comparison to embryonic stem cells (ESCs). A total of 89 mice that survived coronary artery ligation randomly received an intramyocardial injection of undifferentiated pESCs, ESCs, or saline. Sham-operated mice (n = 21) that received no treatment served as control animals. After 7 days, transplantation of pESCs increased expression of pro-angiogenic factors and reduced leucocyte infiltration. By 14 and 30 days post-MI, similar to treatment with ESCs, treatment with pESCs efficiently prevented cardiac remodelling and enhanced angiogenesis, in contrast to saline-treated hearts. Improved heart contractile function was also notable 30 days following transplantation of pESCs. Immunofluorescence staining revealed that tissues regenerated from pESCs in the infarcted myocardium were positive for markers of cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells.

However, there is also a large body of basic science articles that also document that various types of BMP and other members of the TGF-Beta (transforming growth factor beta) family promote the growth of different types of cancers.

Next, however, specific attention is given to the clinical and basic science literature regarding how BMP and its derivatives (e.g. members of the TGF-beta family) may also impact the development of breast and other cancers. Utilizing BMP/INFUSE in spine surgery increased the risk of cancers/new malignancy as documented in several studies. For example, Carragee et al. found that for single-level instrumented posterolateral fusions (PLF) using high-dose rhBMP-2 (239 patients) vs. autograft (control group; n = 224), the risks of new cancers at 2 and 5 years postoperatively were increased. In laboratory studies, BMP's along with other members of the TGF-Beta family also modulated/contributed to the proliferation/differentiation of breast cancer (e.g. bone formation/turnover, breast cancer-related solid tumors, and metastases), lung, adrenal, and colon cancer.",

CIS has been detected using [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography but not using brain perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). The purpose of this study was to optimize brain perfusion SPECT to enable differentiation of DLB from Alzheimer's disease (AD) using CIS and occipital hypoperfusion. Eighteen patients with probable DLB and 17 age-matched Pittsburgh compound B-positive patients with AD underwent technetium-99m ethyl cysteinate dimer SPECT. SPECT Z-score maps were generated using the easy Z-score imaging system (eZIS) analysis software (Matsuda H, Mizumura S, Nagao T, Ota T, Iizuka T, Nemoto K, Takemura N, Arai H, Homma A, AJNR Am J Neuroradiol 28(4):731-6, 2007), which included volumes of interest (VOIs) in which a group comparison between patients with AD and cognitively normal subjects revealed significant relative hypoperfusion. We used the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space anatomical border to divide the bilateral PCG to precunei VOIs into two parts, the PCG and precunei. Z-scores in the PCG, precunei, and occipital areas and ratios were analysed and compared with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses. The largest area under the curve (AUC) value for use in differentiating DLB from AD with the ratio of PCG to medial occipital was 0.87; the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were 85.7, 88.9, and 82.4\u00a0%, respectively. The AUC with the ratio of PCG to the precuneus was smaller, and it was 0.85, though no significant difference was observed between these two AUCs.",

The current study aimed to investigate the effect of GPR34 knockdown on the proliferation, migration, and apoptosis of HGC-27 gastric cancer cells and the underlying mechanisms. The expression of GPR34 in gastric cancer cell line HGC-27 was detected by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blotting. HGC-27 cells were employed to construct the stable GPR34 knockdown cell model in this study. Real-time RT-PCR and Western blotting were applied to validate the effect of short hairpin RNA (ShRNA) on the expression of GPR34 in HGC-27 gastric cells. The proliferation, migration of these cells were examined by Cell Counting Kit-8 and transwell. We also measured expression profile of PI3K/PDK1/AKT and ERK using Western blotting. The ShRNA directed against GPR34 effectively inhibited both endogenous mRNA and protein expression levels of GPR34, and significantly down-regulated the expression of PIK3CB (P < 0.01), PIK3CD (P < 0.01), PDK1 (P < 0.01), phosphorylation of PDK1 (P < 0.01), Akt (P < 0.01), and ERK (P < 0.01).

Sixteen hepatic recombinant microsomal enzymes were screened for 25-hydroxylase activity; 11 had some 25-hydroxylase activity, but CYP3A4 had the highest activity. In characterized liver microsomes, 25-hydroxylase activity correlated significantly with CYP3A4 testosterone 6beta-hydroxylase activity. Activity in pooled liver microsomes was inhibited by known inhibitors of CYP3A4 and by an antibody to CYP3A2. Thus, CYP3A4 is a hepatic microsomal vitamin D 25-hydroxylase. Studies were performed to identify human microsomal vitamin D-25 hydroxylase. Sixteen major hepatic microsomal recombinant enzymes derived from cytochrome P450 cDNAs expressed in baculovirus-infected insect cells were screened for 25-hydroxylase activity with 1alpha-hydroxyvitamin D2 [1alpha(OH)D2], 1alpha-hydroxyvitamin D3 [1alpha(OH)D3], vitamin D2, and vitamin D3 as substrates. Activity was correlated with known biological activities of enzymes in a panel of 12 characterized human liver microsomes. The effects of known inhibitors and specific antibodies on activity also were determined. CYP3A4, the most abundant cytochrome P450 enzyme in human liver and intestine, had 7-fold greater activity than that of any of the other enzymes with 1alpha(OH)D2 as substrate. CYP3A4 25-hydroxylase activity was four times higher with 1alpha(OH)D2 than with 1alpha(OH)D3 as substrate, was much less with vitamin D2, and was not detected with vitamin D3. 1alpha(OH)D2 was the substrate in subsequent experiments. In a panel of characterized human liver microsomes, 25-hydroxylase activity correlated with CYP3A4 testosterone 6beta-hydroxylase activity (r = 0.93, p < 0.001) and CYP2C9*1 diclofenac 4'-hydroxylase activity (r = 0.65, p < 0.05), but not with activity of any of the other enzymes.

Since pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF), one of the adipocytokines, inhibits the AGEs-induced insulin resistance and vascular damage, it is conceivable that besides AGEs, PEDF might also regulate soluble DPP-4 levels. In this study, we addressed the issue. The study involved 188 subjects (123 males and 65 females; mean age of 61.1\u00b19.2) who visited our hospital for a risk-screening test or treatment for cardiovascular disease. They underwent complete history and physical examinations, and determination of blood chemistry and anthropometric variables, including visceral and subcutaneous fat areas.

Alcohol dysregulates the exquisite coordination and regulation of gestational adaptations at the level of the uterine vasculature. We herein hypothesized that chronic binge-like alcohol results in uterine vascular dysfunction and impairs maternal uterine artery reactivity to vasoconstrictors and dilators. We utilized a once-daily binge alcohol (4.5 g/kg body weight) exposure paradigm (gestational day 7 to 17) in a pregnant rat model system and investigated primary uterine artery function in response to vasoconstrictors and vasodilators utilizing wire myography. Alcohol (peak blood alcohol concentration, 216 mg/dl) produced uterine vascular dysfunction. Alcohol did not produce altered uterine vascular reactivity to \u03b11 adrenergic agonist phenylephrine or the prostanoid thromboxane.

Studies have suggested immunoregulatory effects of LPS according to route, dose and stage of exposure. Present study has examined whether dose and stage of LPS exposure (during sensitization and challenge with OVA) exacerbates airway inflammations, antigen specific-IgE level, histamine release, Th1/Th2 cytokine response. Further, anti-asthmatic potential of curcumin, through intranasal route has been evaluated for the first time in LPS induced airway inflammation in an ovalbumin (OVA)-challenged mouse asthma model. Balb/c mice were first sensitized with OVA on 1st and 8th day and exposed to two LPS doses (0.1/1.0 \u03bcg) separately on 2nd day and then further exposed to LPS with OVA-aerosol (from 9 to 14 day). Further, lower LPS dose (0.1 \u03bcg) was chosen for OVA exposed mouse model of asthma exacerbation study. Intranasal curcumin was administered from 9th to 14th day before every LPS exposure. Exposure to LPS (0.1 \u03bcg) exacerbates airway inflammations in terms of IgE level, Th2-cytokine response (IL-4 and IL-5), histamine release, EPO and MPO activities and oxidative stress. Intranasal curcumin has effectively ameliorated airway exacerbations whereas dexamethasone, a known glucocorticosteroid, was not promising as compared to intranasal curcumin.",

Here, we investigate how fatigue affects the inhibitory circuits of the motor cortex. MEPs, short interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) and intracortical facilitation (ICF) were evaluated using a paired pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) paradigm before, during and after a series of 5 isometric contractions of the FDI muscle to 50% maximal voluntary contraction (MVC). Each contraction lasted 2 min and was separated from the next by a pause of 2 min 40 s. Twelve male healthy subjects (range from 22 to 51 years) participated in experiment 1, in which the intensity of test stimulus was constant throughout the experiment. Eight of the same subjects (range from 26 to 51 years) participated in experiment 2, in which the intensity of test stimulus was adjusted so that the amplitude of the test MEP was kept constant throughout the measurement. As expected, test MEPs gradually decreased with progressive fatigue and recovered to control values with 5-10 min of rest. Because of the change in MEP amplitude, changes in percent SICI (reduced inhibition) and percent ICF (increased facilitation) in experiment 1 are difficult to interpret. When the test MEP was maintained at a constant size in experiment 2 there was no change in percent ICF, but the reduction in SICI was still present although it recovered to control values within the first 5-10 min of rest.",

This paper examines the cell biological mechanisms underlying their antineoplastic effects. Colorectal tumor cell lines were used to analyze uptake of the ruthenium(III) complexes into the cells and the mechanism as well as the efficacy of their cytotoxic effects. KP1019 and KP1339 are efficiently taken up into the cells: 100 microM ruthenium(III) complex in the growth medium led to the uptake of 120-160 ng ruthenium per 10(6) cells within 30 min. Uptake of KP418 was tenfold lower correlating with its lower cytotoxic efficiency. KP1019 and KP1339 induced apoptosis in SW480 and HT29 cells predominantly by the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway as indicated by loss of mitochondrial membrane potential.

It is hypothesized that in dyslexia, deficient processing of rapidly changing auditory information underlies a deficient development of phonological representations, causing reading and spelling problems. Low-frequency modulations between 4 and 20 Hz correspond to the processing rate of important phonological segments (syllables and phonemes, respectively) in speech and therefore provide a bridge between low-level auditory and phonological processing. In the present study, temporal modulation processing was investigated by auditory steady state responses (ASSRs) in normal-reading and dyslexic adults. Multichannel ASSRs were recorded in normal-reading and dyslexic adults in response to speech-weighted noise stimuli amplitude modulated at 80, 20, and 4 Hz. The 80 Hz modulation is known to be primarily generated by the brainstem, whereas the 20 and 4 Hz modulations are mainly generated in the cortex. Furthermore, the 20 and 4 Hz modulations provide an objective auditory performance measure related to phonemic- and syllabic-rate processing. In addition to neurophysiological measures, psychophysical tests of speech-in-noise perception and phonological awareness were assessed. On the basis of response strength and phase coherence measures, normal-reading and dyslexic participants showed similar processing at the brainstem level. At the cortical level of the auditory system, dyslexic subjects demonstrated deviant phonemic-rate responses compared with normal readers, whereas no group differences were found for the syllabic rate. Furthermore, a relationship between phonemic-rate ASSRs and psychophysical tests of speech-in-noise perception and phonological awareness was obtained.",

Also, no previous studies have evaluated whether amylin or the endogenous insulin sensitiser adiponectin interact with leptin to alter hippocampal neurogenesis in mouse hippocampal neuronal (HN) cells or investigated the role of leptin, amylin or adiponectin signalling in mouse HN cells. Hippocampal neurogenesis and leptin, amylin and adiponectin signalling were studied in vitro using mouse H19-7 HN cell lines. Amylin decreased cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. This effect was diminished by leptin administration and was dependent on signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)/AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). Adiponectin effects were null. We also observed, using immunocytochemical analysis, that amylin decreased activation of microtubule-associated protein 2, a specific neurite outgrowth marker, and synapsin, a specific synaptogenesis marker. By contrast, both effects were attenuated by co-administration of leptin.

Diverse forms of pulmonary and vascular injury are accompanied by down-regulation of TM, which aggravates tissue injury. We postulated that anchoring TM to the endothelial surface would restore its protective functions. To design an effective and safe strategy to treat pulmonary thrombotic and inflammatory injury. We synthesized a fusion protein, designated scFv/TM, by linking the extracellular domain of mouse TM to a single-chain variable fragment of an antibody to platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1). The targeting and protective functions of scFv/TM were tested in mouse models of lung ischemia-reperfusion and acute lung injury (ALI) caused by intratracheal endotoxin and hyperoxia, both of which caused approximately 50% reduction in the endogenous expression of TM. Biochemical assays showed that scFv/TM accelerated protein C activation by thrombin and bound mouse PECAM-1 and cytokine high mobility group-B1. After intravenous injection, scFv/TM preferentially accumulated in the mouse pulmonary vasculature. In a lung model of ischemia-reperfusion injury, scFv/TM attenuated elevation of early growth response-1, inhibited pulmonary deposition of fibrin and leukocyte infiltration, and preserved blood oxygenation more effectively than soluble TM. In an ALI model, scFv/TM, but not soluble TM, suppressed activation of nuclear factor-kappaB, inflammation and edema in the lung and reduced mortality without causing hemorrhage.",

It is associated with oxidative stress and altered vasoconstrictor tone. This study investigated the \u03b2-adrenoceptor subtype and the signaling pathways implicated in the vascular effects of \u03b2-adrenoceptor overactivation. Mice lacking the \u03b21- or \u03b22-adrenoceptor subtype (\u03b21KO, \u03b22KO) and wild-type (WT) were treated with isoproterenol (ISO, 15 \u03bcg.g(-1) x day(-1), 7 days). ISO significantly enhanced the maximal vasoconstrictor response (Emax) of the aorta to phenylephrine in WT (+34%) and \u03b21KO mice (+35%) but not in \u03b22KO mice.

        "output": "###Rationale:\nOption A: Near-total thyroidectomy\nNear-total thyroidectomy involves the surgical removal of most of the thyroid gland. This option may be considered in cases of hyperthyroidism, particularly when there is a thyroid mass or when other treatment options are not effective or contraindicated. However, in this case, the patient's hyperthyroidism is likely due to Graves' disease, an autoimmune condition. Graves' disease is typically managed with medical therapy, and surgical options are usually reserved for patients who do not respond to medical treatment or have significant complications. Therefore, near-total thyroidectomy is not the most likely long-term management for this patient.\n\nOption B: Methimazole therapy\nMethimazole is an antithyroid medication used to treat hyperthyroidism. It works by inhibiting the production of thyroid hormones. Methimazole is usually the first-line treatment for Graves' disease and is effective in controlling symptoms. However, in this case, the patient's thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) is undetectable, indicating that her hyperthyroidism is caused by stimulation of the thyroid gland by antibodies against the thyrotropin-receptor. Methimazole may be used initially to control symptoms, but it is not the most likely long-term management for this patient.\n\nOption C: Propranolol therapy\nPropranolol is a beta-blocker commonly used to manage symptoms of hyperthyroidism such as palpitations, tremor, and anxiety. It does not treat the underlying cause of hyperthyroidism but can help alleviate symptoms while other treatments take effect. Propranolol is often used as an adjunct therapy along with antithyroid medication or as a temporary measure before surgical intervention. In this case, the patient will require long-term management for her hyperthyroidism and addressing the underlying cause. Therefore, propranolol therapy alone is not the most likely long-term management for this patient.\n\nOption D: L-thyroxine therapy\nL-thyroxine, also known as levothyroxine, is a synthetic form of the thyroid hormone thyroxine (T4). It is commonly used to manage hypothyroidism, a condition characterized by low thyroid hormone levels. However, in this case, the patient has hyperthyroidism due to Graves' disease. The use of L-thyroxine in this context may seem counterintuitive since it adds more thyroid hormone to the body. However, the administration of a single oral dose of radioactive iodine, as mentioned in the scenario, is a common treatment approach for Graves' disease. This radioactive iodine causes destruction of the overactive thyroid cells, resulting in eventual hypothyroidism. Once hypothyroidism develops, long-term management with L-thyroxine is necessary to provide the body with the necessary thyroid hormone replacement. Therefore, L-thyroxine therapy is the most likely long-term management for this patient.\n###Answer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.",

Platelet adhesion onto fibrinogen-coated slips was assessed using a fluorescence laser-scan microscope and compared to the plasma antithrombin activity. Additionally the effect of supraphysiological AT supplementation on platelets adhesion rate was evaluated. Within a first minute of perfusion, an inverse correlation between platelet adhesion and plasma antithrombin were observed at 13 s-1 and 50 s-1 (r = -0.48 and r = -0.7, p < 0.05, respectively).

We assessed the correlation of core length with the other clinical and topographic parameters. We prospectively evaluated data from 509 consecutive patients who underwent a first set of transrectal ultrasound-guided transperineal prostate biopsy for suspected prostate cancer. Fourteen cores were sampled from each patient. Needle cores were stretched and placed in tissue cassettes between two nylon meshes according to the pre-embedding methods of prostate needle biopsy specimens. For single biopsy core, the measurement of length (in millimetres) and any percentage of cancer in the biopsy specimen were reported. The mean length of 7,126 analysed cores was 14.14+/-4.35mm. All cores were longer than 10mm. The mean length of needle cores sampled did not correlate with patient age, total prostate-specific antigen value, digital rectal examination, and prostate volume. The whole mean length of the six samples from the peripheral zone of the right lobe was higher than the mean corresponding value of the six samples from the left lobe peripheral zone (p<0.001).

In agonistic CD40 antibody-mediated inflammatory responses, a novel subset of E-cadherin + dendritic cells (DCs) has been identified, and little is known about the role of these DCs in tumour immunity. This study investigated the effect of anti-CD40-mediated inflammatory E-cadherin + DCs in murine Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC). The phenotype and characteristics of anti-CD40-mediated inflammatory E-cadherin + DCs isolated from the anti-CD40 model were assessed in vitro. The antitumour activity of E-cadherin + DCs were evaluated in vivo by promoting the differentiation of effector CD4+ T cells, CEA-specific CD8+ T cells and CD103+ CD8+ T cells and assessing their resistance to tumour challenge, including variations in tumour volume and survival curves. Here, we demonstrated that anti-CD40-mediated E-cadherin + inflammatory DCs accumulate in the lungs of Rag1 KO mice and were able to stimulate na\u00efve CD4+ T cells to induce Th1 and Th17 cell differentiation and polarisation and to inhibit regulatory T cell and Th2 responses. Importantly, with the adoptive transfer of E-cadherin + DCs into the Lewis lung cancer model, the inflammatory DCs increased the Th1 and Th17 cell responses and reduced the Treg cell and Th2 responses. Interestingly, following the injection of inflammatory E-cadherin + DCs, the CD103+ CD8+ T cell and CEA-specific CD8+ T cell responses increased and exhibited potent antitumour immunity.",

We compared half-dose depot triptorelin (Group I) with reduced-dose daily buserelin (Group II) in a long protocol ICSI/embryo transfer through a double-blind randomized clinical trial. Controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) was started by a pretreatment with oral contraceptives for 21 days. Then, 182 patients were randomized into two groups of 91.

We sought whether LA booster pump function was associated with arrhythmias in patients undergoing primary prevention implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implantation for non-ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy (NICM), independent of global longitudinal strain (GLS) and mechanical dispersion (MD). We identified 124 NICM patients (56 \u00b1 13, 67 male) who underwent echocardiography pre-ICD implantation for primary prevention. The main outcome measure was appropriate ICD therapy (anti-tachycardia pacing or shock). The mitral A-wave was used as an LA functional marker. MD was defined as standard deviation of time to peak strain of each segment. Over a median follow-up of 3.8 \u00b1 2.2 years, 36 patients had appropriate ICD therapy, including 23 shocks. Patients with appropriate ICD therapy had lower A-wave velocity (P < 0.001), larger LA volume (P < 0.001), and impaired circumferential MD (P = 0.006), but similar ejection fraction (EF) (P = 0.40) and GLS (P = 0.11).

Additionally, when ketoprofen is administered in conjunction with an opioid during pain management, it prevents the development of opioid-induced hyperalgesia. The main limitation for racemic ketoprofen IV administration is venous irritation. Dexketoprofen is the active enantiomer of racemic ketoprofen and has a similar analgesic efficacy in a dose proportion of 1\u00a0:\u00a02, but it causes fewer adverse effects than racemic ketoprofen. It has been claimed that dexketoprofen may cause less frequent and less severe injection pain than racemic ketoprofen.

Underlying fibrillin-1 gene mutations cause increased transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) signaling. Although TGF-\u03b2 blockade prevents aneurysms in MFS mouse models, the mechanisms through which excessive TGF-\u03b2 causes aneurysms remain ill-defined. We investigated the role of microRNA-29b (miR-29b) in aneurysm formation in MFS. Using quantitative polymerase chain reaction, we discovered that miR-29b, a microRNA regulating apoptosis and extracellular matrix synthesis/deposition genes, is increased in the ascending aorta of Marfan (Fbn1(C1039G/+)) mice. Increased apoptosis, assessed by increased cleaved caspase-3 and caspase-9, enhanced caspase-3 activity, and decreased levels of the antiapoptotic proteins, Mcl-1 and Bcl-2, were found in the Fbn1(C1039G/+) aorta. Histological evidence of decreased and fragmented elastin was observed exclusively in the Fbn1(C1039G/+) ascending aorta in association with repressed elastin mRNA and increased matrix metalloproteinase-2 expression and activity, both targets of miR-29b. Evidence of decreased activation of nuclear factor \u03baB, a repressor of miR-29b, and a factor suppressed by TGF-\u03b2, was also observed in Fbn1(C1039G/+) aorta. Furthermore, administration of a nuclear factor \u03baB inhibitor increased miR-29b levels, whereas TGF-\u03b2 blockade or losartan effectively decreased miR-29b levels in Fbn1(C1039G/+) mice. Finally, miR-29b blockade by locked nucleic acid antisense oligonucleotides prevented early aneurysm development, aortic wall apoptosis, and extracellular matrix deficiencies.",

        "input": "###Question: Do subjects with diarrhea-predominant IBS have increased rectal permeability responsive to tryptase?\n###Context: Patients with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) appear to have increased intestinal permeability; it has been suggested that activation of protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2) receptors is responsible for this alteration. The aims of this study are to evaluate (1) if rectal (large bowel) permeability is increased in IBS-D and (2) if tryptase plays a critical role in the altered permeability. Rectal biopsies from 20 patients with IBS-D and 30 subjects without the condition (normal controls) were assessed for macromolecular permeability using horseradish peroxidase in Ussing chambers in the basal state and after addition of drugs to the basolateral side. Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed using colonic biopsy tissues from patients with IBS-D and normal subjects. When tryptase was added to the basolateral (not mucosal) side of normal rectal biopsy tissues, permeability appeared to be proportional to the increase in tryptase concentration (P < 0.05) and was abolished by the addition of tryptase inhibitor (100 \u03bcM nafamostat; 1.568 \u00b1 0.874 ng/2 h/mm(2) to 0.766 \u00b1 0.661 ng/2 h/mm(2), n = 14, respectively, P < 0.01). Intestinal permeability in patients with IBS-D was significantly increased compared with controls (0.848 \u00b1 0.0.600 ng/2 h/mm(2), n = 21, P < 0.01). Nafamostat significantly reduced the enhanced permeability in IBS-D (0.934 \u00b1 0.589 ng/2 h/mm(2) to 0.247 \u00b1 0.263 ng/2 h/mm(2), n = 14, respectively, P < 0.05).

The present study aimed to reveal the protective effect of isotetrandrine (ITD), a small molecule inhibitor, on various aspects of LPS-induced inflammation in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo. In\u00a0vitro, RAW 264.7 cells were pretreated with different dose of ITD 1 h before treatment with 1 mg/L of LPS. In\u00a0vivo, to induce ALI, male BALB/c mice were injected intranasally with LPS and treated with ITD (20 and 40 mg/kg) 1 h before LPS. In\u00a0vitro, the cytokine levels of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, and IL-6 in supernatant were reduced by ITD. Meanwhile, in\u00a0vivo, pulmonary inflammatory cell infiltration, myeloperoxidase activity, total cells, neutrophils, macrophages, along with the levels of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were dose-dependently attenuated by ITD.

The algorithm performs clustering in which new sequences are compared with cluster-representative sequences to determine membership. If comparison fails to identify a suitable cluster, a new cluster is created. The performance of the proposed algorithm is validated via comparison to the popular DNA/RNA sequence clustering approach, CD-HIT-EST, and to the recently developed algorithm, UCLUST, using two different sets of 16S rDNA sequences from 2,255 genera. The proposed algorithm maintains a comparable CPU execution time with that of CD-HIT-EST which is much slower than UCLUST, and has successfully generated clusters with higher statistical accuracy than both CD-HIT-EST and UCLUST.

Cortical thickness, subcortical volumes and white matter integrity were compared between C9+ and C9- patients. Using elastic net logistic regression, a model defining the neuroimaging phenotype of C9+ was determined and applied to C9- patients with ALS. C9+ patients showed cortical thinning outside the precentral gyrus, extending to the bilateral pars opercularis, fusiform, lingual, isthmus-cingulate and superior parietal cortex, and smaller volumes of the right hippocampus and bilateral thalamus, and reduced white matter integrity of the inferior and superior longitudinal fasciculus compared with C9- patients (p<0.05).

At harvest, tissues were dissected for immunoblots and serum was collected for ELISA assays. The MRL mouse strain is known for its ability to regenerate ear punch wounds, cardiac cryoinjury, and skeletal muscle disease. Despite gaining weight and increasing their fat deposits the MRL mice were resistant to all other indicators of HFD-induced metabolic alterations assayed.

The etiology is slippage of the head of the radius under the annular ligament. The distal attachment of the annular ligament covering the radial head is weaker in children than in adults, allowing it to be more easily torn. As children age, the annular ligament strengthens, making the condition less common. The oval shape of the proximal radius in cross-section contributes to this condition by offering a more acute angle posteriorly and laterally, with less resistance to slippage of the ligament when axial traction is applied to the extended and pronated forearm. The patient resists supination/pronation as well as flexion/extension of the forearm. Axial traction is the most common cause of nursemaid elbow. A fall is the second most common mechanism of injury.

Recently, HO-1 has been implicated in tumor cell invasion and metastasis. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these biologic effects of HO-1 remain largely unknown. To identify a common mechanism of action of HO-1 in cancer, we determined the global effect of HO-1 on the transcriptome of multiple tumor entities and identified a universal HO-1-associated gene expression signature. Genome-wide expression profiling of Heme Oxygenase-1 expressing versus HO-1 silenced BeWo choriocarcinoma cells as well as a comparative meta-profiling of the preexisting expression database of 190 human tumors of 14 independent cancer types led to the identification of 14 genes, the expression of which correlated strongly and universally with that of HO-1 (P = 0.00002). These genes included regulators of cell plasticity and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling (MMP2, ADAM8, TGFB1, BGN, COL21A1, PXDN), signaling (CRIP2, MICB), amino acid transport and glycosylation (SLC7A1 and ST3GAL2), estrogen and phospholipid biosynthesis (AGPAT2 and HSD17B1), protein stabilization (IFI30), and phosphorylation (ALPPL2). We selected PXDN, an adhesion molecule involved in ECM formation, for further analysis and functional characterization. Immunofluorescence and Western blotting confirmed the positive correlation of expression of PXDN and HO-1 in BeWo cancer cells as well as co-localization of these two proteins in invasive extravillous trophoblast cells. Modulation of HO-1 expression in both loss-of and gain-of function cell models (BeWo and 607B melanoma cells, respectively) demonstrated a direct relationship of HO-1 expression with cell adhesion to Fibronectin and Laminin coated wells. The adhesion-promoting effects of HO-1 were dependent on PXDN expression, as loss of PXDN in HO-1 expressing BeWo and 607B cells led to reduced cell attachment to Laminin and Fibronectin coated wells.",

However, in this case, the patient is presenting with an acute gout attack characterized by severe pain and inflammation. Probenecid is not effective in providing immediate pain relief and is more commonly used as a preventative measure, rather than a treatment for acute attacks. Therefore, it is not the best choice for treating this patient's pain.\n\nOption B: Administer colchicine\nColchicine is an anti-inflammatory medication that is commonly used to treat acute gout attacks. It works by reducing inflammation and relieving pain associated with gout. It is especially effective when given within the first 24 to 48 hours of symptom onset. Therefore, colchicine is a suitable choice for treating this patient's pain.\n\nOption C: Administer indomethacin\nIndomethacin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that is commonly used for the treatment of acute gout attacks. It helps to reduce inflammation and relieve pain associated with gout. Indomethacin is generally considered to be the drug of choice for acute gout attacks due to its effectiveness in providing pain relief. Therefore, indomethacin is a suitable choice for treating this patient's pain. This option is the correct choice.\n\nOption D: Administer febuxostat\nFebuxostat is a medication that is used for the long-term treatment of chronic gout by lowering levels of uric acid in the body. However, it is not indicated for the immediate treatment of acute gout attacks. Therefore, febuxostat is not the best choice for treating this patient's pain.\n###Answer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.",

In central cyanosis, because the etiology is either reduced oxygen saturation or abnormal hemoglobin, the physical findings include bluish discoloration of both mucous membranes and skin.In contrast, peripheral cyanosis is associated with normal oxygen saturation but slowing of blood flow and an increased fraction of oxygen extraction from blood; subsequently, the physical findings are present only in the skin and extremities. Mucous membranes are spared.Peripheral cyanosis is commonly caused by cold exposure with vasoconstriction in the digits.Similar physiology is found in Raynaud's phenomenon. Peripheral vascular disease and deep venous thrombosis result in slowed blood flow and increased oxygen extraction with subsequent cyanosis.

Our aim was to develop an animal model for exploring the pathophysiology and reversibility of AVC, utilizing rats with diet-induced kidney disease. Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 23) were fed a phosphate-enriched, uraemia-inducing diet for 7 weeks followed by a normal diet for 2 weeks ('diet group'). These rats were compared with normal controls (n = 10) and with uraemic controls fed with phosphate-depleted diet ('low-phosphate group', n = 10). Clinical investigations included serum creatinine, phosphate and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels, echocardiography, and multislice computed tomography. Pathological examinations of the valves included histological characterization, Von Kossa staining, and antigen and gene expression analyses. Eight diet group rats were further assessed for reversibility of valve calcification following normalization of their kidney function. At 4 weeks, all diet group rats developed renal failure and hyperparathyroidism. At week 9, renal failure resolved with improvement in the hyperparathyroid state. Echocardiography demonstrated valve calcifications only in diet group rats. Tomographic calcium scores were significantly higher in the diet group compared with controls. Von Kossa stain in diet group valves revealed calcium deposits, positive staining for osteopontin, and CD68. Gene expression analyses revealed overexpression of osteoblast genes and nuclear factor kappaB activation. Valve calcification resolved after diet cessation in parallel with normalization of PTH levels. Resolution was associated with down-regulation of inflammation and osteoblastic features. Low-phosphate group rats developed kidney dysfunction similar to that of the diet group but with normal levels of PTH. Calcium scores and histology showed only minimal valve calcification.",

The distribution and configuration of ICC were observed with immunohistochemistry and electromicroscope. Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence labeling assays showed that SCL gene was successfully delivered to cultured HeLa and ICC cells in vitro. Moreover, significantly increased c-Kit expression could be detected in the colon of Ad-SCL-infected ICC-loss mice. Furthermore, rescue of the ICC network and ICC with typical ultrastructural features could be detected in Ad-SCL-infected ICC-loss mice at day 37.",

This may discharge.* These fluids then set up an irritant reaction in surrounding tissue leading to periductal mastitis or even abscess and fistula formation.* In some cases, a chronic indurated mass forms beneath the areola, which mimics a carcinoma. Fibrosis eventually develops, which may cause slit-like nipple retraction.* A marked association between recurrent periductal inflammation and smoking has been demonstrated. It is certainly clear that cessation of smoking increases the chance of a long-term cure.Clinical features* Nipple discharge (of any colour), a subareolar mass, abscess, mammary duct fistula and/or nipple retraction are the most common symptom/s.Treatment* In the case of a mass or nipple retraction, a carcinoma must be excluded by obtaining a mammogram and negative cytology or histology.

Caspase-8 and -9 are upstream caspases. Caspase-8 mediates the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis triggered by signaling through TNF-R1 family receptors. Caspase-9 is activated during the intrinsic pathway downstream of mitochondria. Caspase-3 is an effector caspase that initiates degradation of the cell in the final stages of apoptosis. Vitamin A is a potent teratogen that causes limb reduction defects in embryos exposed during organogenesis. Previous in vitro studies have shown that exposure of the organogenesis-stage murine limb to vitamin A results in excessive levels of apoptosis. The goal of this work was to characterize the involvement of caspase-3, -8, and -9, as well as cytochrome-c release from the mitochondria, in the apoptotic cascade induced by vitamin A. Limb buds from gestational day 12 CD-1 mice were cultured in a chemically defined medium in the absence or presence of vitamin A. Cultures were terminated after 6 days to examine the effect of the drug on gross morphology. Apoptosis was detected by TUNEL staining after culture for 24 hr. Caspase activation was determined by Western blotting and localized by immunohistochemistry of control and treated limbs. The release of cytochrome-c into the cytoplasm was assessed by Western blotting after cell-fractionation. Limbs cultured in the presence of vitamin A showed a dose-dependent growth reduction and dysmorphogenesis of the cartilaginous anlagen. Apoptosis was increased in the interdigital, anterior, and posterior marginal zones and in the apical ectodermal ridge. Western-blotting confirmed the presence of activated caspase-3 that increased with time in culture and vitamin A concentration. Cleaved caspase-3 immunoreactivity colocalized with TUNEL stained limb regions and increased dramatically with increasing drug concentrations. In contrast, procaspase-8 and -9 were not activated. Exposure to high concentrations of vitamin A did, however, increase cytoplasmic cytochrome-c, suggesting mitochondrial involvement.",

This results in a variety of symptoms, including hypertension and sexual developmental abnormalities. However, this condition would not cause the absence of a uterus, so it is unlikely to be the underlying cause in this case.\n\nOption B: M\u00fcllerian duct agenesis, also known as Mayer-Rokitansky-K\u00fcster-Hauser syndrome, is a genetic disorder that affects the development of the uterus and vagina. In this condition, the uterus and upper part of the vagina are absent or underdeveloped. This matches the symptoms described in the case, where a blind vaginal pouch is found and the uterus is absent. Therefore, this is the most likely underlying cause.\n\nOption C: Androgen insensitivity syndrome is a genetic condition in which the body is unresponsive to male hormones (androgens) due to a defect in the androgen receptor. This results in abnormal development of the external genitalia and, in some cases, the absence or underdevelopment of internal female reproductive structures. However, in this case, the absence of a uterus is the main finding, and androgen insensitivity syndrome is more commonly associated with the presence of a normal uterus.\n\nOption D: Pure gonadal dysgenesis, also known as Swyer syndrome, is a genetic disorder characterized by the absence of functional gonads (ovaries or testes) at birth. Individuals with this condition typically have female external genitalia. However, they often have streak gonads instead of normal ovaries and a uterus. In this case, the presence of ovaries but the absence of a uterus does not fit with the diagnosis of pure gonadal dysgenesis.\n###Answer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.",

There were 57 CRC patients, 30 adenomas patients, and 47 control patients enrolled in this study. Methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction was used to determine the promoter methylation status of GATA5, SFRP2, and ITGA4 genes in plasma DNA, and their association with clinical outcome in CRC. The predictive ability of GATA5, SFRP2, and ITGA4 methylation, individually or in combination, to detect CRC or adenomas was further analyzed. Hypermethylated GATA5 was detected in plasma in 61.4% (35/57) of CRC cases, 43.33% (13/30) of adenoma cases, and 21.28% (10/47) of control cases. The hypermethylation of SFRP2 was detected in 54.39% (31/57), 40.00% (12/30), and 27.66% (13/47) in plasma samples from CRC, adenomas, and controls, respectively. ITGA4 methylation was detected in 36.84% (21/57) of plasma samples of CRC patients and in 30.00% (9/30) of plasma samples from patients with colorectal adenomas, and the specificity of this individual biomarker was 80.85% (9/47). Moreover, GATA5 methylation in the plasma was significantly correlated with larger tumor size (P = 0.019), differentiation status (P = 0.038), TNM stage (P = 0.008), and lymph node metastasis (P = 0.008).

We examined the disposition and movement of mucosa and associated villi during contractions of the everted terminal ileum of the brushtail possum. We then simulated the effect of these movements on peripheral mixing. Compression of the intestinal mucosa by phasic longitudinal or radial contractions created short-lived microfolds, which were of similar scale to the attached villi. The packing density of the villous tips increased in the concavities and decreased on the crests of these microfolds. Simulations showed that these caused liquid digesta to be expelled from, or drawn into, intervillous spaces, significantly augmenting peripheral, but not bulk, luminal mixing.",

        "output": "###Rationale: Dysgerminoma Dysgerminoma corresponds to the seminoma of the testis and accounts for 3-5% of all ovarian tumours. It usually arises in young women or in children, with an average incidence at the age of 20. The tumour is solid with a peculiar elastic rubbery consistency and a smooth, firm capsule. The cut surface is yellow or grey with areas of degeneration and haemorrhage. The size is variable, usually moderate, though large tumours have been described. It is usually unilateral, bilateral in 10%, occasionally undergoes torsion and may, like all solid tumours, be associated with ascites. The tumour consists of large cells arranged in bunches or alveoli. Lymphocytes and giant cells are always found amongst the tumour cells. This appearance of large dark-staining nuclei with clear, almost translucent, cytoplasm and lymphocytic infiltration of the fibrous septa is diagnostic. The tumour is neutral and does not secrete either male or female sex hormones but placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and b-hCG. A number of patients with a dysgerminoma of the ovary have been repoed to show genital abnormality, with hypoplasia or absence of some pa of the genital tract. The malignancy rate is 30-50% and depends largely on the findings at laparotomy A unilateral tumour confined to one ovary is relatively benign. The presence of active invasion of the pelvic viscera is of poor prognosis.

However, potential mechanisms linking these relationships are not well understood. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether stress-related experience of depressive symptoms and reductions in personal mastery were related to alterations in ss2-adrenergic receptor sensitivity. Spousal Alzheimer's caregivers (N = 106) completed measures assessing the extent to which they felt overloaded by their caregiving responsibilities, experienced depressive symptoms, and believed their life circumstances were under their control. We hypothesized that caregivers reporting elevated stress would report increased depressive symptoms and reduced mastery, which in turn would be associated with reduced ss2- adrenergic receptor sensitivity on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), as assessed by in vitro isoproterenol stimulation. Regression analyses indicated that overload was negatively associated with mastery (beta = -0.36, p = 0.001) and receptor sensitivity (beta = -0.24, p = 0.030), whereas mastery was positively associated with receptor sensitivity (beta = 0.29, p = 0.005). Finally, the relationship between overload and receptor sensitivity diminished upon simultaneous entry of mastery.

The role of SIRT1 in osteoarthritis (OA), however, remains partially unknown. To investigate the role of SIRT1 in chondrocytes in vivo, cartilage-specific Sirt1-conditional knockout (CKO) mice were analysed using an experimental OA model. OA was surgically induced in 8-week-old C57BL6/J (wild-type) mice and Sirt1-CKO (Sirt1(flox)/(flox); Col2a1-Cre) mice generated using the Cre-loxP system. We examined changes in Sirt1 protein during the development of surgically-induced OA and during ageing in wild-type mice. OA progression in Sirt1-CKO mice was evaluated histologically at 2, 4 and 8 weeks after surgery, and at 1 year of age without surgery compared with control (Sirt1(flox)/(flox)) mice. The number of Sirt1-positive chondrocytes decreased during ageing, and although it was increased at 2 weeks after surgery, then gradually decreased to the presurgical level during the progression of OA in wild-type mice. Sirt1-CKO mice showed no obvious skeletal abnormalities. The histological OA score was significantly higher in 1-year-old Sirt1-CKO mice than in control mice. Sirt1-CKO mice showed accelerated OA progression at 2 and 4 (but not 8) weeks compared with control mice. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed increases in type X collagen, matrix metalloproteinase 13, a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs-5, apoptotic markers, and acetylated nuclear factor-\u03baB p65 in Sirt1-CKO mice compared with control mice 2 weeks after surgery.",

This may lead to the so-called alert fatigue, an overriding of alerts, including those that are clinically relevant, and underuse of CDSS in general. The aim of our study was to develop and to apply a standardized tool that allows its users to evaluate the quality of system-generated drug alerts. The users' ratings can subsequently be used to derive recommendations for developing a filter function to reduce irrelevant alerts. We developed a rating tool for drug alerts and performed a web-based evaluation study that also included a user review of alerts. In this study the following categories were evaluated: \"data linked correctly\", \"medically correct\", \"action required\", \"medication change\", \"critical alert\", \"information gained\" and \"show again\". For this purpose, 20 anonymized clinical cases were randomly selected and displayed in our customized CDSS research prototype, which used the summary of product characteristics (SPC) for alert generation. All the alerts that were provided were evaluated by 13 physicians. The users' ratings were used to derive a filtering algorithm to reduce overalerting. In total, our CDSS research prototype generated 399 alerts. In 98\u200a% of all alerts, medication data were rated as linked correctly to drug information; in 93\u200a%, the alerts were assessed as \"medically correct\"; 19.5\u200a% of all alerts were rated as \"show again\". The interrater-agreement was, on average, 68.4\u200a%. After the application of our filtering algorithm, the rate of alerts that should be shown again decreased to 14.8\u200a%.",

However, regulation of lipid storage and its role in ccRCC are incompletely understood. Transcriptional profiling of primary ccRCC samples revealed that expression of the LD coat protein gene PLIN2 was elevated in tumors and correlated with HIF2\u03b1, but not HIF1\u03b1, activation. HIF2\u03b1-dependent PLIN2 expression promoted lipid storage, proliferation, and viability in xenograft tumors. Mechanistically, lipid storage maintained integrity of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which is functionally and physically associated with LDs. Specifically, PLIN2-dependent lipid storage suppressed cytotoxic ER stress responses that otherwise result from elevated protein synthetic activity characteristic of ccRCC cells. Thus, in addition to promoting ccRCC proliferation and anabolic metabolism, HIF2\u03b1 modulates lipid storage to sustain ER homeostasis, particularly under conditions of nutrient and oxygen limitation, thereby promoting tumor cell survival.",

However, in this case, the patient's viral load is already high (11,000 copies/mL) and she has not received any antiretroviral therapy during her pregnancy. Therefore, relying solely on intrapartum zidovudine is not sufficient to reduce the risk of HIV transmission to the fetus.

This option is not the most appropriate next step in management.\n\nOption B: Start cART and schedule cesarean delivery at 38 weeks' gestation\nInitiating combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) is important in preventing perinatal transmission of HIV. The patient's viral load is already high, so starting cART is crucial for reducing the viral load and decreasing the risk of transmission. Cesarean delivery before the onset of labor and rupture of membranes significantly reduces the risk of vertical transmission. The recommended gestational age for elective cesarean delivery is 38 weeks. Therefore, this option is the most appropriate next step in management for this patient.\n\nOption C: Start cART and prepare for vaginal delivery at 38 weeks' gestation\nStarting cART is necessary in this patient to decrease the viral load and reduce the risk of perinatal transmission.

In this study, we investigate the exact expression pattern and functions of Mkx in forelimbs. We analyzed the forelimbs of Mkx knockout mice [from embryonic day (E) 18.5 to postnatal day (P) 28 weeks] by using knocked-in Venus signals, Masson trichrome staining, and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. We detected Venus signals in forelimb tendons, pulleys, and volar plates (VPs) in P21 mice. In-depth histological analysis showed that compared to the wild-type mice, the Mkx knockout mice showed significant hypoplasia in the flexor digitorum profundus tendons from E18.5. The VPs and pulleys appeared normal until P0; however, by P14, they became increasingly thicker in Mkx-null mice compared to wild-type mice.

We hypothesized that a tissue plasminogen activator (TPA)/P-selectin fusion protein would have not only thrombolytic activity but also might target TPA to the thrombi. In addition, it seemed possible that this chimeric protein would competitively inhibit the binding of native P-selectin on endothelial cells and platelets to leukocytes and thus further promote thrombolysis. The full-length, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1-resistant form of TPA (TPAIR) together with two TPAIR/P-selectin fusion constructs (P280IR and P121IR) were expressed with the use of baculovirus vectors. After infection of Sf21 cells with the recombinant baculovirus, recombinant TPAIR and P-selectin/TPAIR fusion proteins were purified with the use of metal ion chromatography. The intact protease activity of TPAIR and the ligand binding capability of P-selectin were confirmed through indirect chromogenic and cell binding assays, respectively. These molecules were assessed both in vitro and in vivo for thrombolytic activity. In vitro clot lysis assays indicated equal efficacy of TPAIR, P280IR, and P121IR (P > .5). The in vivo efficacy was tested in a cyclic flow variation model with the use of the rat mesenteric artery.

Improving resistance through conventional breeding has been hampered by a shortage of resistant germplasm and difficulties in introgressing resistance into elite germplasm without linkage drag. The goal of this study was to explore natural variation among wild Solanum species to identify new sources of resistance to necrotrophic fungi and dissect mechanisms underlying resistance against B. cinerea. Among eight wild species evaluated for resistance against B. cinerea and A. solani, S. lycopersicoides expressed the highest levels of resistance against both pathogens. Resistance against B. cinerea manifested as containment of pathogen growth. Through next-generation RNA sequencing and de novo assembly of the S. lycopersicoides transcriptome, changes in gene expression were analyzed during pathogen infection. In response to B. cinerea, differentially expressed transcripts grouped into four categories: genes whose expression rapidly increased then rapidly decreased, genes whose expression rapidly increased and plateaued, genes whose expression continually increased, and genes with decreased expression. Homology-based searches also identified a limited number of highly expressed B. cinerea genes. Almost immediately after infection by B. cinerea, S. lycopersicoides suppressed photosynthesis and metabolic processes involved in growth, energy generation, and response to stimuli, and simultaneously induced various defense-related genes, including pathogenesis-related protein 1 (PR1), a beta-1,3-glucanase (glucanase), and a subtilisin-like protease, indicating a shift in priority towards defense. Moreover, cluster analysis revealed novel, uncharacterized genes that may play roles in defense against necrotrophic fungal pathogens in S. lycopersicoides. The expression of orthologous defense-related genes in S. lycopersicum after infection with B. cinerea revealed differences in the onset and intensity of induction, thus illuminating a potential mechanism explaining the increased susceptibility. Additionally, metabolic pathway analyses identified putative defense-related categories of secondary metabolites.",

This study sought to test the hypothesis that regional cooling destabilizes rotors and facilitates termination of spontaneous and DC shock-induced subepicardial reentry in isolated, endocardially ablated rabbit hearts. Fluorescent action potential signals were recorded from 2-D subepicardial ventricular myocardium of Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts. Regional cooling (by 5.9\u00b0C \u00b1 1.3\u00b0C) was applied to the left ventricular anterior wall using a transparent cooling device (10 mm in diameter). Regional cooling during constant stimulation (2.5 Hz) prolonged the action potential duration (by 36% \u00b1 9%) and slightly reduced conduction velocity (by 4% \u00b1 4%) in the cooled region. Ventricular tachycardias (VTs) induced during regional cooling terminated earlier than those without cooling (control): VTs lasting >30 seconds were reduced from 17 of 39 to 1 of 61. When regional cooling was applied during sustained VTs (>120 seconds), 16 of 33 (48%) sustained VTs self-terminated in 12.5 \u00b1 5.1 seconds. VT termination was the result of rotor destabilization, which was characterized by unpinning, drift toward the periphery of the cooled region, and subsequent collision with boundaries. The DC shock intensity required for cardioversion of the sustained VTs decreased significantly by regional cooling (22.8 \u00b1 4.1 V, n = 16, vs 40.5 \u00b1 17.6 V, n = 21). The major mode of reentry termination by DC shocks was phase resetting in the absence of cooling, whereas it was unpinning in the presence of cooling.",

SGCA gene expression increased 4-5-fold over control sides when examined at 6 weeks (2 subjects) and 3 months (1 subject). The full sarcoglycan complex was restored in all subjects, and muscle fiber size was increased in the 3-month subject. Adeno-associated virus serotype 1 (AAV1)-neutralizing antibodies were seen as early as 2 weeks. Neither CD4+ nor CD8+ cells were increased over contralateral sides. Scattered foci of inflammation could be found, but showed features of programmed cell death. Enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) showed no interferon-gamma response to alpha-SG or AAV1 capsid peptide pools, with the exception of a minimal capsid response in 1 subject. Restimulation to detect low-frequency capsid-specific T cells by ELISpot assays was negative. Results of the first 3 subjects successfully achieved study aims, precluding the need for additional enrollment.",

In the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) we investigated whether perinatal inhibition of NF-\u03baB persistently decreases blood pressure. To probe antihypertensive mechanisms we studied natriuresis and sensitivity of blood pressure and renal hemodynamics to the superoxide dismutase mimetic Tempol. Perinatal pyrrolidine di thio carbamate (PDTC) (a NF-\u03baB inhibitor), administered during pregnancy and lactation to SHR dams, persistently ameliorated hypertension up to 28 weeks of age in their offspring. Furthermore, after perinatal treatment with PDTC natriuresis was temporarily doubled at 4 weeks of age in both females and males. Urinary excretion of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (an indirect measure of oxidative stress) was decreased by perinatal PDTC, persistently in females and temporarily in males. At 28 weeks, Tempol reduced arterial pressure in all groups, but had opposite effects in control and perinatal PDTC rats on renal vascular resistance (RVR), namely decreased RVR in controls and increased RVR in perinatal PDTC rats.",

The aim of the present study was to investigate the potential impact of H. pylori status on the prognosis of patients with gastric cancer in a Chinese prospective cohort. Between 2007 and 2009, 261 patients with curatively resected gastric cancer were enrolled in the study. H. pylori status was defined by means of immunohistochemical staining in tumour and non-neoplastic tissues. Treatment prognosis was measured in terms of cancer-specific survival and disease-free survival (dfs). Univariate and multivariate Cox regression models were used to assess the association between H. pylori status and patient prognosis. Positivity for H. pylori infection was observed in 188 of the 261 patients (72.0%). In patients positive for H. pylori, mean cancer-specific survival was 55.2 months [95% confidence interval (ci): 53.4 to 56.9 months] and mean dfs was 53.9 months (95% ci: 51.8 to 56.0 months); the same survivals were, respectively, 45.1 months (95% ci: 42.2 to 47.9 months) and 43.7 months (95% ci: 40.4 to 47.0 months) in patients negative for H. pylori. In univariate analysis, positive H. pylori status was associated with better cancer-specific survival [hazard ratio (hr): 0.486; 95% ci: 0.271 to 0.870; p = 0.015] and dfs (hr: 0.540; 95% ci: 0.307 to 0.950; p = 0.033).

Understanding the immunological relevance of these models is of increasing importance as immunotherapeutic drugs are developed against MM. We set out to examine how cellular immunity is affected in Vk*MYC mouse models and compare that to the immunology of patients with newly diagnosed and relapsed/refractory MM. We found that there were significant immunological responses in mice developing either spontaneous (transgenic) or transplanted MM as a consequence of the degree of tumor burden. Particularly striking were the profound B cell lymphopenia and the expansion of CD8(+) effector memory T cells within the lymphocyte population that progressively developed with advancing disease burden, mirroring changes seen in human MM. High disease burden was also associated with increased inflammatory cytokine production by T lymphocytes, which is more fitting with relapsed/refractory MM in humans.",

It affects 230,000 individuals worldwide, has a very high mortality rate, and remains one of the most challenging malignancies to treat successfully. Treatment with gemcitabine, the most widely used chemotherapeutic against pancreatic cancer, is not curative and resistance may occur. Combinations of gemcitabine with other chemotherapeutic drugs or biological agents have resulted in limited improvement. In order to improve gemcitabine response in pancreatic cancer cells, we utilized a synthetic lethal RNAi screen targeting 572 known kinases to identify genes that when silenced would sensitize pancreatic cancer cells to gemcitabine. Results from the RNAi screens identified several genes that, when silenced, potentiated the growth inhibitory effects of gemcitabine in pancreatic cancer cells. The greatest potentiation was shown by siRNA targeting checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1). Validation of the screening results was performed in MIA PaCa-2 and BxPC3 pancreatic cancer cells by examining the dose response of gemcitabine treatment in the presence of either CHK1 or CHK2 siRNA. These results showed a three to ten-fold decrease in the EC50 for CHK1 siRNA-treated cells versus control siRNA-treated cells while treatment with CHK2 siRNA resulted in no change compared to controls. CHK1 was further targeted with specific small molecule inhibitors SB 218078 and PD 407824 in combination with gemcitabine. Results showed that treatment of MIA PaCa-2 cells with either of the CHK1 inhibitors SB 218078 or PD 407824 led to sensitization of the pancreatic cancer cells to gemcitabine.",

This shell prevents the hea from expanding when blood enters it. This results in significant respiratory variation in blood flow in the chambers of the hea. During inspiration, pressure in the thoracic cavity decreases but is not relayed to the left atrium, subsequently a reduction in flow to the left atrium and ventricle happens. During diastole, less blood flow in left ventricle allows for more room for filling in right ventricle and therefore a septal shift occurs. During expiration, the amount of blood entering the right ventricle will decrease, allowing the interventricular septum to bulge towards the right ventricle, and increased filling of the left ventricle and subsequent increased pressure generated by the left ventricle during systole.This is known as ventricular interdependence, since the amount of blood flow into one ventricle is dependent on the amount of blood flow into the other ventricle. Signs and symptoms of constrictive pericarditis are consistent with the following: fatigue, swollen abdomen, difficulty breathing (dyspnea), swelling of legs and general weakness. Related conditions are bacterial pericarditis, pericarditis and pericarditis after a hea attack Diagnosis: The diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis is often difficult to make. In paicular, restrictive cardiomyopathy has many similar clinical features to constrictive pericarditis, and differentiating them in a paicular individual is often a diagnostic dilemma. Chest X-Ray - pericardial calcification (common but not specific), pleural effusions are common findings. Echocardiography - the principal echographic finding is changes in cardiac chamber volume. CT and MRI - useful in select cases. BNP blood test - tests for the existence of the cardiac hormone brain natriuretic peptide, which is only present in RCMP but not in CP Conventional cardiac catheterization Physical examination - can reveal clinical features including Kussmaul&;s sign and a pericardial knock Treatment: The definitive treatment for constrictive pericarditis is pericardial stripping, which is a surgical procedure where the entire pericardium is peeled away from the hea. This procedure has significant risk involved,with moality rates of 6% or higher in major referral centers. A poor outcome is almost always the result after a pericardiectomy is performed for constrictive pericarditis whose origin was radiation-induced, fuher some patients may develop hea failure post-operatively.

Eleven patients thus completed 3-6 weekly ketamine infusions.

In the absence of rigorous data, some investigators have proposed that fat returns after liposuction. A prospective study was undertaken among predominantly nonobese consecutive patients undergoing 301 liposuction and abdominoplasty procedures meeting the study criteria (inclusion rate, 70.7 percent). Lower body dimensions were measured using standardized photographs taken before and at least 3 months after surgery. Upper body measurements were compared between women who underwent simultaneous cosmetic breast surgery (n=67) and a group of women who had breast surgery alone (n=78) to investigate the possibility of fat redistribution. The average weight change was a loss of 2.2 lbs after lower body liposuction (p<0.01) and 4.6 lbs when combined with abdominoplasty (p<0.001). Liposuction significantly reduced abdominal, thigh, knee, and arm width (p<0.001). Midabdominal and hip width were more effectively reduced by lipoabdominoplasty than liposuction alone (p<0.001). There was no difference in upper body measurements when comparing patients who had simultaneous liposuction and/or abdominoplasty with patients who had cosmetic breast surgery alone.

The disease may begin as a minor flu-like illness that rapidly escalates into a fulminant infection. It is most common in the first two years after splenectomy but may occur decades later. Splenectomy may be followed by severe systemic infection because such surgery removes the splenic macrophages that filter and phagocytose bacteria and other bloodborne pathogens. Overwhelming post-splenectomy infection (OPSI) is uncommon but has high moality. Overwhelming post-splenectomy infection is usually caused by the encapsulated bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis and more than half of those infected die.

Complications may impact patient quality of life and increase costs; therefore, an understanding of which preoperative variables best predict 30-day complications will help risk-stratify patients and guide therapeutic decision making and informed consent. We retrospectively reviewed 200 cases of spinal metastasis surgically treated at Stanford Hospital between 1999 and 2009. Multiple logistic regression was performed to determine which preoperative variables were independent predictors of 30-day complications. Sixty-eight patients (34%) experienced one or more complications within 30 days of surgery. The most common complications were respiratory failure, venous thromboembolism, and pneumonia.

Therefore, we examined whether human fetal hepatocytes are amenable to telomerase-mediated immortalization without inducing a transformed phenotype and disrupting their differentiation potential. Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein that plays a pivotal role in maintaining telomere length and chromosome stability. Human somatic cells, including hepatocytes, exhibit no telomerase activity. Consequently, their telomeres progressively shorten with each cell cycle until critically short telomeres trigger replicative senescence. The catalytic subunit, telomerase reverse transcriptase, was expressed in human fetal hepatocytes. Transduced cells were characterized for telomerase activity, telomere length, proliferative capacity, hepatocellular functions, oncogenicity, and their in vivo maturation potential. The expression of human telomerase reverse transcriptase restored telomerase activity in human fetal hepatocytes. Telomerase-reconstituted cells were capable of preserving elongated telomeres, propagated in culture beyond replicative senescence for more than 300 cell doublings (to date), and maintained their liver-specific nature, as analyzed by a panel of hepatic growth factors, growth factor receptors, and transcription factors as well as albumin, glucose-6-phosphatase, glycogen synthesis, cytochrome P450 (CYP) expression profiles, and urea production.

In this work, we used suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) to investigate the molecular signature of melanoma progression, by comparing a group of metastatic cell lines with an RGP-like cell line showing characteristics of early neoplastic lesions including expression of the metastasis suppressor KISS1, lack of alphavbeta3-integrin and low levels of RHOC. Two subtracted cDNA collections were obtained, one (RGP library) by subtracting the RGP cell line (WM1552C) cDNA from a cDNA pool from four metastatic cell lines (WM9, WM852, 1205Lu and WM1617), and the other (Met library) by the reverse subtraction. Clones were sequenced and annotated, and expression validation was done by Northern blot and RT-PCR. Gene Ontology annotation and searches in large-scale melanoma expression studies were done for the genes identified. We identified 367 clones from the RGP library and 386 from the Met library, of which 351 and 368, respectively, match human mRNA sequences, representing 288 and 217 annotated genes. We confirmed the differential expression of all genes selected for validation. In the Met library, we found an enrichment of genes in the growth factors/receptor, adhesion and motility categories whereas in the RGP library, enriched categories were nucleotide biosynthesis, DNA packing/repair, and macromolecular/vesicular trafficking. Interestingly, 19% of the genes from the RGP library map to chromosome 1 against 4% of the ones from Met library.",

Long occlusions may be treated by the technique of subintimal angioplasty where the guide wire crosses the lesion in the subintimal space (in the arterial wall) and a new lumen is created by inflation of the balloon. Complications occur in about 5 per cent of cases and include failure, haematoma, bleeding, thrombosis and distal embolisation.Autogenous saphenous vein gives the best results and can be used reversed or in situ after valve disruption.If the long saphenous vein is not available from either leg, short saphenous or arm veins may be used.If no vein is available, a prosthetic polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) graft may be employed, although patency rates are less; many surgeons construct the lower anastomosis using a small collar of vein (Miller cuff) between the PTFE and the recipient artery, which may improve patency.If no suitable vein is available, prosthetic material (usually PTFE) may be used, with or without a small vein collar (Miller cuff) at its distal end.A femoro-femoral crossover graft involves tunneling a prosthetic graft subcutaneously above the pubis between the groins.An axillo-femoral graft is tunneled subcutaneously between the axillary artery proximally, to reach one or both of the femoral arteries; the patency rates of an axillo-bifemoral bypass is better than an axillo (uni) femoral bypass.Results of operation:Long-term results of aortoiliac reconstructive surgery are good, usually marred only by progressive infrainguinal disease.Femoropopliteal surgery is less successful.Immediate postoperative success for vein bypass exceeds 90%, but the five-year patency is around 60%.PTFE-covered stents are engineered with a 30-100 micron pore size to allow for endothelial lining of the stent-graft and vessel healing.

It is, however, unknown whether endogenous vasopressin concentration is associated with kidney function decline in subjects with ADPKD. We measured plasma copeptin (a marker of vasopressin) in 79 ADPKD subjects with renal function assessed during short-term follow-up by inulin clearance measured glomerular filtration rate (mGFR) and during long-term follow-up by Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation estimated GFR (eGFR).

Real-time PCR was used to detect the effects of CpG ODN on MMP-13 mRNA expression levels in a murine odontoblast-lineage cell line (OLCs). The possible involvement of TLR9/MyD88, NF-\u03baB or MAPK pathways involved in the CpG ODN-induced MMP-13 expression was examined by real-time PCR, transient transfection, luciferase activity assay and ELISA. Western blotting was performed to assay the phosphorylation of ERK at a range of time points. MMP-13 was constitutively expressed in OLCs, and their exposure to CpG ODN significantly increased MMP-13 expression. Pre-treatment of OLCs with the inhibitory peptide MyD88, or chloroquine, attenuated the CpG ODN-induced expression of MMP-13. Treatment of the OLCs with CpG ODN increased NF-\u03baB-luciferase activity. This activity was decreased by the over-expression of a nondegrading mutant of I\u03baB\u03b1 (I\u03baB\u03b1SR), although enhanced by the over-expression of NF-\u03baB p65.

To identify genes up-regulated by action of morphine on the opioid receptor expressed in CD3+ T cells, PCR-select cDNA subtraction was performed by the use of total RNA from human CD3+ T cells treated with morphine in the presence and absence of naloxone. We show that p53 and damage-specific DNA binding protein 2 (ddb2) genes are up-regulated by morphine in a naloxone-sensitive manner.

There are disagreements within the microarray scientific community for intra- and inter-platform consistency of these platforms. Both high and low consistencies were demonstrated across different platforms in terms of genes with significantly differential expression. Array studies for gene expression are used to explore biological causes and effects. Therefore, consistency should eventually be evaluated in a biological setting to reveal the functional differences between the examined samples, not just a list of differentially expressed genes (DEG). In this study, we investigated whether different platforms had a high consistency from the biologically functional perspective. DEG data without filtering the different probes in microarrays from different platforms generated from kidney samples of rats treated with the kidney carcinogen, aristolochic acid, in five test sites using microarrays from Affymetrix, Applied Biosystems, Agilent, and GE health platforms (two sites using Affymetrix for intra-platform comparison) were input into the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) system for functional analysis. The functions of the DEG lists determined by IPA were compared across the four different platforms and two test sites for Affymetrix platform.

However, the current understanding of the nuclear phosphorylation responses to activated EGFR pathways remains limited. In the present study, phosphoproteomics analysis revealed the increased phosphorylation of 90 nuclear proteins, primarily involved in RNA processing, pre-mRNA splicing and cell cycle regulation, upon EGF stimulation in MDA-MB-468 cells. Cellular splicing assays of the \u03b2-globin (HBB) minigene confirmed that EGF induced constitutive pre-mRNA splicing. Further analysis of phosphoproteomics data identified multiple CDK1/2 substrates in pre-mRNA splicing-related proteins, and both CDK1/2 inhibitors and CDK1/2 knockdowns reduced EGF-regulated pre-mRNA splicing.

Recombinant granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) shortens neutropenia following intensive chemotherapy, but potential benefits in the therapy of ALL remain inadequately explored. Accordingly, a randomized, crossover study was undertaken to clarify this issue. Seventeen children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia or T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma and treated on standard protocols were randomized to receive G-CSF following either the first or second intensification blocks of chemotherapy. G-CSF was administered as a single daily subcutaneous injection of 5 mcg/kg from day 9 following the start of intensification therapy, and continued until the neutrophil count exceeded 0.5 x 10(9)/l for 3 days. Study endpoints were days of neutropenia (neutrophils < 1 x 10(9)/l) and severe neutropenia (neutrophils < 0.5 x 10(9)/l), days in hospital, days of fever, and days on antibiotics.

The criteria for diagnosing metabolic syndrome differ among ethnic groups, due in part to differences in eating habits and body build. Little is known about the relationship between metabolic syndrome and ischemic stroke in Asian countries. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between metabolic syndrome and first-time ischemic strokes. Study subjects were 1,493 Japanese adults aged 55 years-old or older with no diabetes mellitus, no history of stroke and no neurological abnormalities, who participated in a voluntary neurological health screening at the Institute of Shimane Health Science, Japan (767 men, 62.0 +/- 5.9 years old at entry and 726 women, 61.8 +/- 5.1 years old at entry). All subjects were given an annual clinical stroke questionnaire. Clinical details of patients who reported strokes were confirmed with the attending physicians. Each subject was evaluated for an average of 6.4 +/- 3.8 years. Metabolic syndrome was defined using the modified criteria for Japanese population published in April 2005. Metabolic syndrome was diagnosed in 11.0% of men and 1.1% of women. Adjusting for age and smoking, female subjects with metabolic syndrome had a 23.1-fold increased risk of suffering ischemic strokes [95% confidence interval (CI), 2.7-196], whereas metabolic syndrome did not increase the risk of ischemic stroke in men.",

However, it may be difficult to identify nodal involvement by conventional pathological examination of hematoxylin-eosin (HE)-stained sections when metastases are of microscopic size. In the present study, an attempt was made to detect lymph node metastasis precisely from gallbladder carcinoma, even by low-power microscopic examination, using immunohistochemistry with an anti-cytokeratin antibody. A total of 431 lymph node specimens dissected during surgery from 33 patients with carcinoma of the gallbladder were investigated. A pair of mirror-image sections were obtained from each of the dissected lymph nodes and then stained using standard HE and immunohistochemical methods utilizing a monoclonal antibody against cytokeratin 7. The HE- and immunohistochemically stained sections were examined for the presence of tumor cells using light microscopy. All 78 lymph nodes from 12 patients with early gallbladder carcinoma were negative for both HE- and cytokeratin-positive cancer cells. Of 353 lymph nodes from 21 patients with advanced gallbladder carcinoma, HE staining showed that 98 were metastasis-positive. Among these 98 lymph nodes, 95 (97%) proved to be positive for metastasis based on cytokeratin immunostaining. On the other hand, the remaining 255 lymph nodes were cancer-free on the basis of HE staining results. Of the 255 HE-negative lymph nodes, seven (2.7%) were found to be positive for micrometastasis on the basis of cytokeratin staining.",

The 2 groups of mice were analyzed for serum levels of interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interleukin-1beta as well as activation of NFkappaB and STAT1, 2 proinflammatory transcription factors. NK cell-depleted and NK cell-deficient mice exhibited 80% survival in the face of an intraperitoneal bacterial challenge, whereas control mice all died within 12 hours.

Recently, bispectral analysis of the EEG has been developed as a better method to indicate nonlinear regulation including the thalamocortical system linking to the cortical area. In the present study, in order to explore the interference of ketamine with the nonlinear regulation of the sub-cortical system, we examined the effect of ketamine on spindle alpha waves through the bispectral analysis. The study included 21 patients. Anaesthesia was induced and maintained using a propofol-TCI system (target-controlled infusion, with target concentration 3.5 microg ml(-1)). An A-2000 BIS monitor was used and the raw EEG signals were collected via an RS232 interface on a personal computer. Bicoherence, the normalized bispectrum, and power spectrum were analysed before and after i.v. administration of 1 mg kg(-1) racemic ketamine. Propofol caused alpha peaks in both power and bicoherence spectra, with average frequencies of 10.6 (SD 0.9) Hz and 10.7 (1.0) Hz, respectively. The addition of ketamine significantly shifted each peak to frequencies of 14.4 (1.4) Hz and 13.6 (1.5) Hz, respectively [P < 0.05, mean (SD)].",

We studied the effects of carbohydrate availability on growth, differentiation and metabolism of C2C12 myoblasts and myotubes. We measured growth rates, ability to differentiate, citrate synthase and respiratory chain activities and several parameters of mitochondrial respiration in C2C12 cells grown in media with varying carbohydrate availability (5 g/l glucose, 1 g/l glucose, 1 g/l galactose, and no added carbohydrates). C2C12 myoblasts grow more slowly without glucose irrespective of the presence of galactose, which is not consumed by the cells, and they fail to differentiate without glucose in the medium. Cells grown in a no-glucose medium (with or without galactose) have lower maximal respiration and spare respiratory capacity than cells grown in the presence of glucose. However, increasing glucose concentration above physiological levels decreases the achievable maximal respiration. C2C12 myotubes differentiated at a high glucose concentration showed higher dependency on oxidative respiration under basal conditions but had lower maximal and spare respiratory capacity when compared to cells differentiated under low glucose condition. Citrate synthase activity or mitochondrial yield were not significantly affected by changes in the available substrate concentration but a trend towards a higher respiratory chain activity was observed at reduced glucose levels.",

        "output": "###Rationale: Gastrin is produced by cells called G cells in the antral poion of the gastric mucosa.G cells are flask-shaped, with a broad base containing many gastrin granules and a narrow apex that reaches the mucosal surface. Microvilli project from the apical end into the lumen. Receptors mediating gastrin responses to changes in gastric contents are present on the microvilli. Other cells in the gastrointestinal tract that secrete hormones have a similar morphology. Gastrin is typical of a number of polypeptide hormones in that it shows both microheterogeneity and microheterogeneity. Microheterogeneity refers to the occurrence in tissues and body fluids of peptide chains of various lengths; microheterogeneity refers to differences in molecular structure due to derivatization of single amino acid residues. preprogastrin is processed into fragments of various sizes. Three main fragments contain 34, 17, and 14 amino acid residues. All have the same carboxyl terminal configuration. In large doses, gastrin has a variety of actions, but its principal physiologic actions are stimulation of gastric acid and pepsin secretion and stimulation of the growth of the mucosa of the stomach and small and large intestines (trophic action). Gastrin secretion is affected by the contents of the stomach, the rate of discharge of the vagus nerves, and bloodborne factors. Atropine does not inhibit the gastrin response to a test meal in humans, because the transmitter secreted by the postganglionic vagal fibers that innervate the G cells is gastrin-releasing polypeptide rather than acetylcholine. Gastrin secretion is also increased by the presence of the products of protein digestion in the stomach, paicularly amino acids, which act directly on the G cells. Phenylalanine and tryptophan are paicularly effective. The acid in the antrum inhibits gastrin secretion, paly by a direct action on G cells and paly by release of somatostatin, a relatively potent inhibitor of gastric secretion. The effect of acid is the basis of a negative feedback loop regulating gastrin secretion. Increased secretion of the hormone increases acid secretion, but the acid then feeds back to inhibit fuher gastrin secretion. In conditions such as pernicious anemia in which the acid-secreting cells of the stomach are damaged, gastrin secretion is chronically elevated.REF: GANONG&;S REVIEW OF MEDICAL PHYSIOLOGY, KIM BARRETT, HEDDWEN BROOKS, SCOTT BOITANO, SUSAN BARMANTWENTY THIRD EDITIONPAGE NO:443\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.",

We determined whether DNA promoter hypermethylation of genes frequently methylated in esophageal adenocarcinoma (p16 and APC) could be used as predictors of progression in BE. We first performed a cross-sectional study to evaluate the prevalence of gene hypermethylation in biopsies from patients with normal esophagus (n=17), BE (n=102), and adenocarcinoma (n=42). We then performed a nested case-control study comparing gene hypermethylation in BE patients who progressed from baseline pathology to high-grade dysplasia or cancer (n=7) vs. patients who did not progress (n=50). None of the patients with normal esophagus had p16 or APC hypermethylation. Hypermethylation was prevalent in BE without dysplasia or low-grade dysplasia (p16=31% and APC=50%; P<0.01) and high-grade dysplasia or adenocarcinoma (p16=54% and APC=68%; P<0.001) compared with normal esophagus (not detected).

Moreover, it is unclear whether these changes have prognostic impact. The aim of this study was to examine these issues. Three hundred and eighty-seven CHF patients were assessed twice (at baseline and at 12-month follow-up) for exertion and general fatigue. Regression models were developed to assess whether baseline characteristics predicted changes in fatigue and to assess the effect of changes in fatigue on cardiac events occurring beyond 12-months of follow-up. An increase in exertion fatigue over a 12-month period was predicted by higher left ventricular ejection fraction (P = 0.02) and cognitive-affective depressive symptoms (P = 0.03) at baseline, and not having a biventricular pacemaker shortly after baseline (P = 0.02), whereas an increase in general fatigue was only predicted by cognitive-affective depressive symptoms (P = 0.002).

However, this class of receptors consists of two subtypes, delta1, and delta2, and mu- or kappa-opioid receptors may also exist in the heart. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to test the hypothesis that ischemic preconditioning is mediated through stimulation of one or both delta-opioid receptor subtypes. Anesthetized, open chest, male Wistar rats were assigned to 1 of 14 groups. All animals were subjected to 30 minutes of occlusion and 2 hours of reperfusion. Ischemic preconditioning was elicited by three 5-minute occlusion periods interspersed with 5 minutes of reperfusion. Two doses of 7-benzylidenenaltrexone (BNTX; 1 and 3 mg/kg i.v.), a selective delta1-opioid receptor antagonist, or naltriben (NTB; 1 and 3 mg/kg i.v.), a selective delta2-opioid receptor antagonist, were given before ischemic preconditioning. To test for a role of mu-opioid receptors, rats were pretreated with beta-funaltrexamine (beta-FNA; 15 mg/kg s.c), an irreversible mu-opioid receptor antagonist, 24 hours before ischemic preconditioning or given the mu-opioid receptor agonist D-Ala,2N-Me-Phe,4glycerol5-enkephalin (DAMGO) as three 5-minute infusions (1, 10, and 100 microg/kg per infusion i.v., respectively) interspersed with 5-minute drug-free periods before the prolonged ischemic and reperfusion periods (lowDAMGO, medDAMGO, and hiDAMGO, respectively). The involvement of kappa-opioid receptors was tested by administering one of two doses of nor-binaltorphimine (nor-BNI; 1 and 5 mg/kg i.v.) before ischemic preconditioning. Infarct size (IS) as a percent of the area at risk (AAR) was measured by triphenyltetrazolium stain. Ischemic preconditioning markedly reduced IS/AAR (14+/-4%, P<.05) compared with control (55+/-4%). NTB, beta-FNA, and nor-BNI were unable to block the cardioprotective effect of ischemic preconditioning. In addition, DAMGO had no effect on IS/AAR.

Peroxisomes and mitochondria play key roles in various hepatic metabolic functions including lipid metabolism and energy production. To investigate the involvement of these organelles in the mechanisms underlying malnutrition-induced hepatic dysfunction we developed a rat model of malnutrition. Weanling rats were placed on a low protein or control diet (5% or 20% of calories from protein, respectively) for four weeks. Peroxisomal and mitochondrial structural features were characterized using immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. Mitochondrial function was assessed using high-resolution respirometry. A novel targeted quantitative proteomics method was applied to analyze 47 mitochondrial proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation, tricarboxylic acid cycle and fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation pathways. Low protein diet-fed rats developed hypoalbuminemia and hepatic steatosis, consistent with the human phenotype. Hepatic peroxisome content was decreased and metabolomic analysis indicated peroxisomal dysfunction. This was followed by changes in mitochondrial ultrastructure and increased mitochondrial content. Mitochondrial function was impaired due to multiple defects affecting respiratory chain complex I and IV, pyruvate uptake and several \u03b2-oxidation enzymes, leading to strongly reduced hepatic ATP levels. Fenofibrate supplementation restored hepatic peroxisome abundance and increased mitochondrial \u03b2-oxidation capacity, resulting in reduced steatosis and normalization of ATP and plasma albumin levels.",

Four waves of the Baltimore-Epidemiologic Catchment Area (Baltimore ECA) Study conducted between 1981 and 2004 were linked to Medicare claims data for the years 1999 to 2004 from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). Generalized linear models specified with a gamma distribution and log link function were used to examine direct medical care costs associated with MDD. Medicare recipients with no history of MDD in either the ECA or CMS data had mean six-year medical costs of US $40,670, compared to $87,445 for Medicare recipients with MDD as recorded in CMS data and $43,583 for those with MDD as recorded in Baltimore-ECA data. Multivariable regressions found that compared to Medicare recipients with no history of depression, those with depression identified in the CMS data had significantly higher medical costs; about 1.87 times (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.32 to 2.67) higher. Medicare recipients with a history of depression identified in the ECA data were no more likely to have higher costs than were Medicare recipients with no history of depression (relative ratio 1.33, 95% CI 0.87 to 2.02).",

        "output": "###Rationale: Ans. is 'c' i.e., Telomerase* A person can be young only until the person can replenish the losses periodically, for which the cells should be pushed into cell cycle regularly.* Telomeres are ends of chromosomes which help in maintaining the stability of our chromosomes. When we are born we are born with a particular telomeric length. As cells get into cell cycle, during replication, the telomeric end is progressively shortened. This happens because for DNA polymerase to replicate a DNA, we need to add RNA primers first. So ends of chromosome are replaced by RNA during replication. This RNA being labile gets lost.* After 50 to 70 cell divisions, the telomeric ends reach a critical or minimum length called as Hayflick limit. Beyond hayflick limit length of telomere, if the cells are allowed to get into cell cycle, the telomere length is not good enough to maintain the stability of chromosomes. The chromosomes accumulate mutation. To avoid accumulation of mutation, once a cell has reached the critical length of telomere, the cells are not allowed to get into cell cycle any more. When the cells are not able to get into cell cycle, the losses are not being replenished and that is when ageing begins.* To avoid this we are provided with a telomerase enzyme. Telomerase is a reverse transcriptase. IT has RNA dependent DNA polymerase activity. Based on the RNA fragments left back in the terminals as a result of replication, Telomerase synthesises and replaces DNA fragments. Hence the length of telomeric ends can be maintained and ageing is prevented.* Hence telomerase is an antiageing enzyme.\n\n###Answer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.",

Impaired cerebral perfusion can cause hemispheric dysfunction, which can be rapidly quantified with bedside tests of hemispatial neglect. We hypothesized that hospitalized patients with laboratory markers consistent with dehydration or a volume contracted state (VCS) would have more severe cerebral dysfunction defined by greater degree of neglect. Subjects were a consecutive series of right-handed patients with acute right hemispheric stroke admitted within the Johns Hopkins Health System. All participants had clinical syndrome and magnetic resonance imaging consistent with acute infarction. The primary definition of a VCS was a urea/creatinine ratio >15, with secondary definition including urine specific gravity over 1.010.

Migraine, especially with aura (MA), is a known risk factor for ischemic stroke. The association between CAD and migraine was suggested based on a few small studies, but there are no large-scale case-control data, and the mechanisms are not yet clear. We compared the lifetime prevalence of migraine and migraine characteristics in 313 CAD patients with 313 healthy age- and sex-matched controls. We also analyzed clinical and radiological characteristics of CAD with respect to migraine subtypes to investigate whether clear phenotypical associations can be found that might help in the search for a possible shared genetic background for migraine and CAD. Migraine was clearly more common in CAD patients than in controls (36 vs. 23%; OR 2.15; 95% CI 1.48-3.14), and the association was also highly significant for MA (23 vs. 12%; OR 2.41; 95% CI 1.53-3.80).

Our primary measures of ovarian age were antim\u00fcllerian hormone (AMH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels. The cross-sectional sample comprised 258 women with karyotyped spontaneous abortions (140 trisomic spontaneous abortions and 118 chromosomally normal spontaneous abortions or spontaneous abortions with anomalies other than trisomy) and 325 women with recent live births (LBs). We analyzed data from the total sample and data from LBs only. We defined CGG repeat length by the length (both continuous and categorical) on the longer allele. CGG repeat length was not significantly associated with either hormone measure. A repeat length of 35 to 54 CGG, versus the modal category of 30 CGG, was associated with an approximately 7% increase in median AMH level and a 3% increase in median FSH level. Results were unaltered when analyses were limited to LBs. Analyses of hormone levels using cutpoints to define older ovarian age showed no associations with repeat length.

Intestinal permeability is associated with alterations in cellular tight junctions involving the structural proteins occludin and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1). The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of continuous blood purification (CBP) on gut barrier function in patients with MODS. Serum diamine oxidase (DAO) and endotoxin, epithelial monolayer permeability, and transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) were used as markers for the assessment of gut barrier function in 22 patients with MODS who underwent continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CWH) for 24 hours. Blood samples were taken from patients at 0, 6, 12, and 24 hours during CWH therapy. Serum DAO and endotoxin were determined by spectrophotography. Permeability and TER were assessed using Caco-2 cell monolayers. Occludin and ZO-1 protein levels were analyzed by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence staining. And inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) mRNA levels and nitric oxide (NO) production were determined by real-time PCR and spectrophotography, respectively. Gut barrier dysfunction was evident in patients with MODS compared with normal controls. Serum DAO, endotoxin levels, and epithelial permeability were elevated, while TER was decreased in patients with MODS, and this change was more pronounced in nonsurvivors. Breakdown and reorganization of occludin and ZO-1 away from tight junctions was found in all MODS patients. After CBP treatment, APACHE II and MODS scores improved significantly. Serum DAO and endotoxin levels and epithelial permeability also diminished, while TER increased in all patients; CBP significantly attenuated breakdown and reorganization of tight junction proteins, and also attenuated the inflammation-induced increase in iNOS mRNA expression and NO production.",

        "input": "###Question: Do aPOL1 null alleles from a rural village in India correlate with glomerulosclerosis?\n###Context: Among African-Americans, genome wide association revealed a strong correlation between the G1 and G2 alleles of APOL1 (apolipoproteinL1, also called trypanolytic factor) and kidney diseases including focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis, HIV-associated nephropathy and hypertensive nephrosclerosis. In the prevailing hypothesis, heterozygous APOL1 G1 and G2 alleles increase resistance against Trypanosoma that cause African sleeping sickness, resulting in positive selection of these alleles, but when homozygous the G1 and G2 alleles predispose to glomerulosclerosis. While efforts are underway to screen patients for G1 and G2 alleles and to better understand \"APOL1 glomerulopathy,\" no data prove that these APOL1 sequence variants cause glomerulosclerosis. G1 and G2 correlate best with glomerulosclerosis as recessive alleles, which suggests a loss of function mutation for which proof of causality is commonly tested with homozygous null alleles. This test cannot be performed in rodents as the APOL gene cluster evolved only in primates. However, there is a homozygous APOL1 null human being who lives in a village in rural India. This individual and his family offer a unique opportunity to test causality between APOL1 null alleles and glomerulosclerosis. We obtained clinical data, blood and urine from this APOL1 null patient and 50 related villagers. Based on measurements of blood pressure, BUN, creatinine, albuminuria, genotyping and immunoblotting, this APOL1 null individual does not have glomerulosclerosis, nor do his relatives who carry APOL1 null alleles.",

Diagnosis of FM is difficult due to the lack of reliable diagnostic biomarkers, while treatment is largely inadequate. We have investigated the role of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) deficiency and mitochondrial dysfunction in inflammasome activation in blood cells from FM patients, and in vitro and in vivo CoQ10 deficiency models. Mitochondrial dysfunction was accompanied by increased protein expression of interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, NLRP3 (NOD-like receptor family, pyrin domain containing 3) and caspase-1 activation, and an increase of serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18). CoQ10 deficiency induced by p-aminobenzoate treatment in blood mononuclear cells and mice showed NLRP3 inflammasome activation with marked algesia. A placebo-controlled trial of CoQ10 in FM patients has shown a reduced NLRP3 inflammasome activation and IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 serum levels. These results show an important role for the NLRP3 inflammasome in the pathogenesis of FM, and the capacity of CoQ10 in the control of inflammasome.",

In a prospective pilot study, we recruited 14 subjects with suboptimally controlled insulin-treated Type-2 and Type-1 diabetes. Subjects were treated with basal-bolus insulin therapy that was titrated weekly for 12 weeks. Dosage adjustments were made by the study Endocrinologist by reviewing subjects' glucose readings, exclusively based on logsheets and contingent upon the approval of the on-site study team. To corroborate that the glucose readings were sufficient for making dosage adjustments, we used software to process only glucose readings and recommend insulin dosage adjustments.

Current practice differs considerably, from cessation of the medication at least 5 days before surgery to proceeding with surgery without delay. The purpose of this prospective, nonrandomized, comparative study was to determine the effect of preoperative exposure to clopidogrel and aspirin on perioperative bleeding complications in patients undergoing open arterial surgery. Data were collected prospectively on 647 consecutive major arterial procedures from 2005 through mid-2012. Patients were classified into two groups: the clopidogrel group consisted of 305 procedures performed in 269 patients who were maintained, after obtaining informed consent, on dual clopidogrel and aspirin up to the time of surgery and the no-clopidogrel group consisted of 342 procedures completed in 298 patients who were taking neither medication together or were taking aspirin alone. The primary composite end point was reoperation for bleeding and bleeding-related death. Secondary end points included blood transfusion requirements, hematoma formation, the procedure duration, as well as hospital and intensive care unit length of stay. The patients taking clopidogrel had a higher cardiovascular risk profile and a higher prevalence of prior peripheral and coronary stents (P\u00a0< .0001). Clopidogrel use was common across all operation categories: 59% of carotid endarterectomy patients (104 of 177), 43% of lower extremity bypass patients (147 of 344), and 43% of abdominal aortic bypass patients (54 of 126). The difference in the primary end point between the clopidogrel and no-clopidogrel groups was not statistically significant (0.65% and 0.3%, respectively; P =.55). No bleeding-related deaths were observed. Further analysis revealed a similar incidence of stable hematomas. Blood transfusions were mainly required by patients undergoing aortic surgery, at similar rates and volumes in the clopidogrel and no-clopidogrel groups: abdominal aortic bypass cohort (a mean of 1.6 units packed red blood cells needed in 72% vs a mean of 1.6 units in 69%, respectively; P\u00a0=.76); lower extremity bypass cohort (a mean of 1.5 units needed in 15% vs 1.3 units needed in 11%; P\u00a0<\u00a0.004).

SLO were extracted using modified Clevenger type apparatus. Acute toxicity test was used in mice to observe its safety level. Antinociceptive activity of SLO was evaluated in acetic acid induced writhing and hot plate tests. Yeast induced hyperthermic mice and pentylenetetrazole induced convulsive mice were used for the assessment of its antipyretic and anticonvulsant profile respectively. Substantial safety was observed for SLO in acute toxicity test. SLO showed a high significant activity in acetic acid induced writhing test in a dose dependent manner with maximum pain attenuation of 68.48% at 200 mg/kg i.p. However, it did not produce any relief in thermal induced pain at test doses. When challenged against pyrexia evoked by yeast, SLO manifested marked amelioration in hyperthermic mice, dose dependently. Maximum anti-hyperthermic activity (75%) was observed at 200 mg/kg i.p. after 4 h of drug administration. Nevertheless, SLO had no effect on seizures control and mortality caused by pentylenetetrazole.",

Challenges arise because climate data are at resolutions that do not readily synchronize with arthropod biology. Here we explain how multiple sources of climate and weather data can be synthesized to quantify the effects of climate change on pest phenology. Predictions of phenological events differ substantially between models that incorporate scale-appropriate temperature variability and models that do not. As an illustrative example, we predicted adult emergence of a pest of sunflower, the sunflower stem weevil Cylindrocopturus adspersus (LeConte). Predictions of the timing of phenological events differed by an average of 11 days between models with different temperature variability inputs.

We retrospectively assessed whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of DNA-repair genes ERCC1, XPD, XRCC1 and glutathione S-transferase genes GSTP1, GSTT1 and GSTM1 predict overall survival (OS), response and toxicity in 119 non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with platinum-based regimens as first- or second-line chemotherapy. Patients' genotypes were determined by PCR-RFLP and sequencing approaches. ERCC1 (Asn118Asn) genotype was significantly associated with response to treatment. Patients with either one or two C alleles (C/C, C/T) at Asn118Asn were more likely to respond to platinum-based chemotherapy compared with those without the C allele (Odds ratio, 0.10; 95% CI, 0.013-0.828; P = .033, by binary logistic regression).

However, it has been reported that induction of fibrinogen binding and platelet aggregation is an intrinsic prothrombotic property of low-dose GP IIb/IIIa antagonists. These apparently paradoxical results have been extensively referenced in the cardiology literature. By platelet aggregation and flow cytometry, we demonstrate that (1) dissociation of GP IIb/IIIa antagonists (abciximab, tirofiban, eptifibatide, or xemilofiban) from platelets does not result in platelet aggregation; (2) tirofiban and eptifibatide can induce a fibrinogen-binding-competent conformation of the GP IIb/IIIa receptor, but stable fibrinogen binding does not occur without fixation; (3) the slow off-rate of abciximab exposes only a small proportion of unblocked GP IIb/IIIa receptors at any time, and these also fail to stably bind fibrinogen; and (4) the GP IIb/IIIa antagonist-induced fibrinogen binding in some previously reported experiments was probably the result of artifactual thrombin generation.",

We previously demonstrated that blockade of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), the receptor for TGF-alpha, significantly slowed disease progression in the bpk murine model of autosomal-recessive kidney disease (ARPKD). In the present study, kidney TGF-alpha expression in this model is characterized, and the therapeutic potential of inhibiting TGF-alpha in ARPKD is examined using a novel inhibitor of tumor necrosis factor-alpha converting enzyme (TACE), the metalloproteinase that cleaves membrane-bound TGF-alpha to release the secreted ligand. Immunohistochemistry (IH) and Western analysis were performed on kidneys from cystic bpk mice and noncystic littermates at postnatal days 7, 14, and 21. Bpk mice and normal controls were treated with WTACE2, a competitive inhibitor of TACE, from day 7 until day 21, and the effects on kidney histology and renal function were assessed. Increased TGF-alpha expression by IH was demonstrated in the proximal tubules (PT) at postnatal day 7 and collecting tubules (CT) by day 21. A parallel increase in kidney TGF-alpha expression was demonstrated by Western analysis. Treatment of cystic bpk mice with WTACE2 resulted in a 43% reduction in kidney weight to body weight ratio (11.2 vs. 19.7%), improved cystic index (3.2 vs. 4.8), reduced cystic CT to PT ratio (1.2 vs. 8), and a greater than 30% reduction in BUN and serum creatinine.",

TouchCUTANEOUS MECHANORECEPTORS: -Sensory receptors can be specialized dendritic endings of afferent nerve fibers, and they are often associated with non- neural cells that surround them forming a sense organ. Touch and pressure are sensed by four types of mechanoreceptors.a. Meissner corpuscles are dendrites encapsulated in connective tissue and respond to changes in texture and slow vibrations.b. Merkel cells are expanded dendritic endings, and they respond to sustained pressure and touch.c. Ruffini corpuscles are enlarged dendritic endings with elongated capsules, and they respond to sustained pressure.d. Pacinian corpuscles consist of unmyelinated dendritic endings of a sensory nerve fiber, 2 um in diameter, encapsulated by concentric lamellae of connective tissue that give the organ the appearance of a cocktail onion. These receptors respond to deep pressure and fast vibration.e. The sensory nerves from these mechanoreceptors are large myelinated Aa and Ab fibers whose conduction velocities range from ~ 70-120 to ~ 40-75 m/s, respectively.a. Sensory systems encode four elementary attributes of stimuli: modality, location (receptive field), intensity, and duration (timing).b. The human hand has four types of mechanoreceptors; their combined activation produces the sensation of contact with an object. Selective activation of Merkel cells and Ruffini endings causes sensation of steady pressure; selective activation of Meissner and Pacinian corpuscles causes tingling and vibratory sensation.c. Location of a stimulus is encoded by spatial distribution of the population of receptors activated. A receptor fires only when the skin close to its sensory terminals is touched. These receptive fields of mechanoreceptors (shown as red areas on fingertips) differ in size and response to touch. Merkel cells and Meissner corpuscles provide the most precise localization as they have the smallest receptive fields and are most sensitive to pressure applied by a small probe.d. Stimulus intensity is signaled by firing rates of individual receptors; duration of stimulus is signaled by time course of firing. The spike trains indicate action potentials elicited by pressure from a small probe at the center of each receptive field.

Cartilage degeneration hallmarks OA pathogenesis, and pannexin 3 (Panx3), a member of a novel family of channel proteins, is upregulated during this process. The function of Panx3 remains poorly understood, but we consistently observed a strong increase in Panx3 immunostaining in OA lesions in both mice and humans. Here, we developed and characterized the first global and conditional Panx3 knockout mice to investigate the role of Panx3 in OA. Interestingly, global Panx3 deletion produced no overt phenotype and had no obvious effect on early skeletal development. Mice lacking Panx3 specifically in the cartilage and global Panx3 knockout mice were markedly resistant to the development of OA following destabilization of medial meniscus surgery. These data indicate a specific catabolic role of Panx3 in articular cartilage and identify Panx3 as a potential therapeutic target for OA.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the mechanism by which prior inhibition of NO synthesis can lessen ischemia-reperfusion injury in the isolated rabbit heart. We examined the effects of inhibition of NO synthesis on infarct size using a model of coronary artery ligation in isolated rabbit hearts perfused at a constant flow rate of 35 mL/min. Infarct size averaged 65% of the zone at risk after 45 minutes of ischemia and 180 minutes of reperfusion. The addition of 30 mumol/L NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), an inhibitor of NO synthesis, to the perfusate reduced the infarct-to-risk (I/R) ratio to an average of 41% (P < .05 versus control). This effect was abolished by pretreatment with 75.5 mumol/L 8-p-sulfophenyl theophylline (SPT), an adenosine receptor antagonist (I/R ratio, 63%). Ischemic preconditioning (5 minutes of ischemia and 10 minutes of reperfusion) before 45 minutes of ischemia and 3 hours of reperfusion reduced the I/R ratio to an average of 21%, and this was not augmented by pretreatment with L-NAME (I/R ratio, 20%). However, all protection due to preconditioning and L-NAME was lost in hearts pretreated with SPT (I/R ratio, 59%). In a separate set of experiments, adenosine concentration in the coronary perfusate and myocardial lactate concentrations were measured. Treatment with L-NAME increased the average adenosine concentration in the perfusate from 5.7 mumol/L per 100 g of heart (control) to a peak of 24.0 mumol/L per 100 g of heart; however, there was no effect on average myocardial lactate concentration (control, 4.6 mumol/g dry wt; L-NAME, 5.5 mumol/g dry wt). In contrast, after 5 minutes of global ischemia, the average adenosine concentration peaked at 139.0 mumol/L per 100 g of heart, and the average myocardial lactate concentration increased to 27.1 mumol/g dry wt.",

Thus expeditious diagnosis and timely treatment are critical to achieve the optimal clinical outcome.All children diagnosed with Kawasaki disease are treated at the time of diagnosis.The recommended initial therapy includes: -Intravenous immunoglobulin administered as single infection andAspirinIntravenous immunoglobulinSince the first report of intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) therapy, randomized controlled studies and meta analyses have confirmed that IVIG plus aspirin compared to aspirin alone reduces the risk of coronary artery aneurysm.Although aspirin does not appear to affect aneurysm formation all trials of IVIG treatment have included aspirin as well since it was treatment of choice at the time IVIG was introduced.The mechanism of beneficial effect of IVIG remains unknown.IVIG appears to have a generalized anti-inflammatory effect with reduction of fever and acute markers of inflammation.Possible mechanisms for these actions are cytokine level and production, neutralizing bacterial super antigens.Treatment of Kawasaki diseaseAcute stageIntravenous immunoglobulin with aspirin.Convalescent stageAspirin 3-5 mg/kg once daily orally until 6-8 week illness onset.Long-term therapy for those with coronary abnormalitiesAspirin 3-5 mg/kg once daily orally+- dipyridamole 4-6 mg/kg/24 hr, divided in two-three doses orally.Acute coronary thrombosisPrompt fibrinolytic therapy with tissue plasminogen activator, streptokinase or urokinase under supervision of cardiologist\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.",

Dynamic 2D and 3D CEUS were used to assess the vascularity of FLLs in 83 patients. The two analyses were carried out sequentially following a bolus intravenous injection of SonoVue contrast agent, one injection of 1.5-2mL was given for each part of the study (one for the 2D and another for the 3D). Due to the large data volume for 3D analysis, only the arterial phase (20-25s) was recorded and analyzed. The data were analyzed by two independent analysts. The current study included a total of 83 patients with FLL. The diagnosis was established based on histopathology, Computed Tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Among the 83 cases, 61 were hepatocellular carcinomas (include 10 metastasis, 51 HCCs), and the remaining 22 were benign lesions: hemangiomas (n=15), focal nodular hyperplasias (n=4), and inflammatory lesions (n=3).

Nevertheless, its cell-activating effects have not been analyzed in a comprehensive direct comparison including a wide range of different immune cells. Therefore, the objective of this study was the side-by-side comparison of the immune-modulating properties of MPLA and LPS on different immune cells. Immune-activating properties of MPLA and LPS were compared in human monocytes and mast cells (MCs), a mouse endotoxin shock model (ESM), and mouse bone marrow (BM)-derived myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs), T\u00a0cells (TCs), B\u00a0cells, and MCs. In a mouse in\u00a0vivo ESM and a human ex\u00a0vivo monocyte activation test (MAT), MPLA induced the same cytokine secretion pattern as LPS (ESM: IL-6, IL-12, TNF-\u03b1; MAT: IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1), albeit at lower levels. Mouse mDCs and ex\u00a0vivo isolated B\u00a0cells stimulated with MPLA required a higher threshold to induce TRIF-dependent cytokine secretion (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-\u03b1) than did LPS-stimulated cells. In mDC:DO11.10 CD4 TC cocultures, stimulation with MPLA, but not with LPS, resulted in enhanced OVA-specific IL-4 and IL-5 secretion from DO11.10 CD4 TCs. Unexpectedly, in both human and mouse MCs, MPLA, unlike LPS, did not elicit secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines.",

To rigorously define the role of DPP-IV in the immune system, we evaluated genetic and pharmacological inhibition of the enzyme on T-dependent immune responses in vivo. The DPP-IV null animals mounted robust primary and secondary antibody responses to the T dependent antigens, 4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenylacetyl-ovalbumin (NP-Ova) and 4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenylacetyl-chicken gamma globulin (NP-CGG), which were comparable to wild type mice. Serum levels of antigen specific IgM, IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b and IgG3 were similar between the two groups of animals. DPP-IV null animals mounted an efficient germinal center reaction by day 10 after antigen stimulation that was comparable to wild type mice. Moreover, the antibodies produced by DPP-IV null animals after repeated antigenic challenge were affinity matured. Similar observations were made using wild type animals treated with a highly selective DPP-IV inhibitor during the entire course of the experiments. T cell recall responses to ovalbumin and MOG peptide, evaluated by measuring proliferation and IL-2 release from cells isolated from draining lymph nodes, were equivalent in DPP-IV null and wild type animals. Furthermore, mice treated with DPP-IV inhibitor had intact T-cell recall responses to MOG peptide. In addition, female DPP-IV null and wild type mice treated with DPP-IV inhibitor exhibited normal and robust in vivo cytotoxic T cell responses after challenge with cells expressing the male H-Y minor histocompatibility antigen.",

The present study investigated the involvement of endogenous NGF in spontaneous reparative response to ischemia. Mechanisms and therapeutic potential of NGF-induced neovascularization were examined. Unilateral limb ischemia was produced in CD1 mice by femoral artery resection. By ELISA and immunohistochemistry, we documented that statement of NGF and its high-affinity receptor is upregulated in ischemic muscles. The functional relevance of this phenomenon was assessed by means of NGF-neutralizing antibody. Chronic NGF blockade abrogated the spontaneous capillarization response to ischemia and augmented myocyte apoptosis. Then we tested whether NGF administration may exert curative effects. Repeated NGF injection into ischemic adductors increased capillary and arteriole density, reduced endothelial cell and myofiber apoptosis, and accelerated perfusion recovery, without altering systemic hemodynamics. In normoperfused muscles, NFG-induced capillarization was blocked by vascular endothelial growth factor-neutralizing antibodies, dominant-negative Akt, or NO synthase inhibition.",

Leptin is an adipocyte-derived hormone that acts as a regulator of energy homeostasis and food intake. Emerging evidence suggests that leptin can regulate immune responses including the release of proinflammatory cytokines and protection of inflammatory cells from apoptosis.

Bioinformatics analysis was carried out to select potential mircroRNAs that binds CD81 3'untranslated region. Liver biopsies taken from 28 HCV genotype- 4 patients and 10 healthy donors were screened. Na\u00efve, JFH1 and ED43/JFH1- infected- Huh7 cells were transfected with mimics and inhibitors followed by analyzing CD81 protein and mRNA expression.

Binding confirmation was done using luciferase reporter vector harboring wild/mutant target sites of microRNA. The impact of Epigallocatechin-gallate on modulating microRNA/CD81 expression was assessed. Bioinformatics revealed that CD81 is a potential down-stream target for miR-194. A significant inverse correlation was found between miR-194 and CD81 expression in liver biopsies of HCV patients. Forcing the expression of miR-194 showed a down-regulation of CD81 protein, mRNA expression and significantly abrogated the HCV infectivity of Huh7 cells.

Clinically, these signatures are usually used in early-stage cancers to evaluate whether they require adjuvant therapy following surgical resection. A molecular signature that is prognostic across more clinical contexts would be a useful addition to current signatures. We defined a signature for the ubiquitous tissue factor, E2F4, based on its shared target genes in multiple tissues. These target genes were identified by chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) experiments using a probabilistic method. We then computationally calculated the regulatory activity score (RAS) of E2F4 in cancer tissues, and examined how E2F4 RAS correlates with patient survival. Genes in our E2F4 signature were 21-fold more likely to be correlated with breast cancer patient survival time compared to randomly selected genes. Using eight independent breast cancer datasets containing over 1,900 unique samples, we stratified patients into low and high E2F4 RAS groups. E2F4 activity stratification was highly predictive of patient outcome, and our results remained robust even when controlling for many factors including patient age, tumor size, grade, estrogen receptor (ER) status, lymph node (LN) status, whether the patient received adjuvant therapy, and the patient's other prognostic indices such as Adjuvant! and the Nottingham Prognostic Index scores. Furthermore, the fractions of samples with positive E2F4 RAS vary in different intrinsic breast cancer subtypes, consistent with the different survival profiles of these subtypes.",

Previously, we have established the pivotal role of membrane fluidity in ethanol-induced oxidative stress, but no study has so far tested the involvement of lipid rafts. In this study, methyl-beta-cyclodextrin or cholesterol oxidase, which were found to disrupt lipid rafts in hepatocytes, inhibited both reactive oxygen species production and lipid peroxidation, and this suggested a role for these microstructures in oxidative stress. By immunostaining of lipid raft components, a raft clustering was detected in ethanol-treated hepatocytes. In addition, we found that rafts were modified by formation of malondialdehyde adducts and disulfide bridges. Interestingly, pretreatment of cells by 4-methyl-pyrazole (to inhibit ethanol metabolism) and various antioxidants prevented the ethanol-induced raft aggregation. In addition, treatment of hepatocytes by a stabilizing agent (ursodeoxycholic acid) or a fluidizing compound [2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethyl 8-(cis-2-n-octylcyclopropyl)octanoate] led to inhibition or enhancement of raft clustering, respectively, which pointed to a relationship between membrane fluidity and lipid rafts during ethanol-induced oxidative stress. We finally investigated the involvement of phospholipase C in raft-induced oxidative stress upon ethanol exposure. Phospholipase C was shown to be translocated into rafts and to participate in oxidative stress by controlling hepatocyte iron content.",

Moreover, we examined the effects of oral etretinate, a drug that definitely produces dry, scaly lips, on the lips of seven male patients aged 49-89 (average 67) years. TEWL was significantly almost three times as high on the lips as that on the cheek which is a site that shows far higher levels than do other body areas. TEWL decreased with age more remarkably on the lip than on the cheek. High-frequency conductance, a parameter for surface hydration state, was significantly lower on the lip than on the cheek.

For that purpose, type IIa dyslipidemic patients (cholesterol, 7.45+/-1.18 (S.D.) mmol/l; LDL cholesterol, 5.57+/-1.16 mmol/l; triglycerides (TGs), 1.66+/-0.43 mmol/l) were randomized to either fenofibrate (n=36) or pravastatin (n=43) therapy for 16 weeks. Fasting plasma lipoprotein levels as well as the LDL peak particle size (using 2-16% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) were assessed at baseline and after the 16-week treatment period. Whereas significant improvements in the plasma lipoprotein-lipid variables were observed with both fenofibrate and pravastatin treatments, LDL peak particle size was only significantly increased with fenofibrate therapy (+2.11+/-5.18 A, P<0.05). Among patients under fenofibrate therapy, changes in TG levels were negatively associated with changes in LDL peak particle size (r=-0.54, P<0.0007), whereas no such association was found in pravastatin-treated patients. The prevalence of patients with small, dense LDL particles (as defined by LDL particle diameter <255.5 A) was reduced from 69.4 to 30.6% (P<0.05) among fenofibrate-treated patients as opposed to 81.4 to 72.1% (NS) in patients who received pravastatin.",

In this study, a separate question was investigated, the basis of the variation in sperm phenotype within gr/gr deletion carriers, which ranges from normozoospermia to azoospermia. Differences in the genes removed by independent gr/gr deletions, the occurrence of subsequent duplications or the presence of linked modifying variants elsewhere on the chromosome have been suggested as possible causal factors. This study set out to test these possibilities in a large sample of gr/gr deletion carriers with known phenotypes spanning the complete range. In total, 169 men diagnosed with gr/gr deletions from six centres in Europe and one in Australia were studied. The DAZ and CDY1 copies retained, the presence or absence of duplications and the Y-chromosomal haplogroup were characterised. Although the study had good power to detect factors that accounted for >or=5.5% of the variation in sperm concentration, no such factor was found. A negative effect of gr/gr deletions followed by b2/b4 duplication was found within the normospermic group, which remains to be further explored in a larger study population. Finally, significant geographical differences in the frequency of different subtypes of gr/gr deletions were found, which may have relevance for the interpretation of case control studies dealing with admixed populations.",

In addition, chemoattractants other than classical chemokines can also be present. Many chemokines have been demonstrated to cooperate, leading to an augmentation in leukocyte recruitment and providing a potential role for the presence of multiple chemoattractants. Extracellular cyclophilins are a group of alternative chemotactic factors, which can be highly elevated during various inflammatory responses and, as we have previously shown, can contribute significantly to neutrophil recruitment in an animal model of acute lung inflammation. In the current studies we investigated whether the most abundant extracellular cyclophilin, CypA, has the capacity to function in partnership with 2 classical chemokines known to be secreted in the same model, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-2/CXCL2 and keratinocyte chemoattractant (KC)/CXCL1. Neutrophil migration in response to combinations of CypA and MIP-2 or CypA and KC was measured by in vitro chemotaxis assays. Biochemical responses of neutrophils incubated with the combinations of chemoattractants were determined by changes in chemokine receptor internalization and actin polymerization measured by flow cytometry, and changes in intracellular calcium mobilization measured with a calcium sensitive fluorochrome. A combination of CypA and MIP-2, but not KC, augmented neutrophil migration. Based on the level of augmentation, the cooperation between CypA and MIP-2 appeared to be synergistic. Evidence that CypA and MIP-2 cooperate at the biochemical level was demonstrated by increases in receptor internalization, calcium mobilization, and actin polymerization.",

Therefore, capitate morphology may influence contact pressures at the capitolunate articulation and influence clinical outcomes after PRC. However, it remains unclear which diagnostic imaging technique most reliably distinguishes between capitate morphologies.

Two attending hand surgeons and one hand surgery fellow characterized capitate type based on each imaging modality. True capitate type was determined after gross dissection. We determined the reliability of each modality to predict capitate morphology. We found all four imaging modalities to have a low sensitivity and specificity for predicting capitate morphology.

Thirty-one single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in and near CRHR-2, obtained from an array of 2.5 million markers, were tested for association with PTSD diagnosis and symptom severity in the whole sample and in men and women separately. Ten SNPs showed nominally significant evidence of association with PTSD in the full sample and two SNPs (rs8192496 and rs2190242) were significant after permutation-based multiple testing correction (uncorrected ps = .0004 and .0005, odds ratios = .60 and .58, respectively). Analyses stratified by sex revealed that the effect was specific to women, who comprised 35% of the sample (uncorrected ps = .0003 and .0002, odds ratios = .41 and .35, respectively). Two additional SNPs (rs2267715 and rs2284218) also showed significant association with PTSD in women (both uncorrected ps = .001, both odds ratios = .48).",

It has been postulated that amphetamine induces free radical formation. On this basis, we have hypothesized that Khat may promote synthesis of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species in the same way that amphetamine promotes free radical production. Forty male subjects were enrolled in two groups: those with a chronic Khat chewing habit (n=20), and those without a chewing habit (controls; n=20). Both groups were matched with regard to age. Total antioxidant capacity and cholinesterase (AChE) activity were assayed. This study showed that Khat consumption inhibited serum free radical scavenging enzymes, resulting in significant elevations in free radical loads (p=0.01; n=20).

Hepatic expression of bile transporters was studied before and after transplantation. Histopathological criteria as well as biliary concentrations of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and gamma-glutamyltransferase (gamma-GT) were used to quantify bile duct injury. Early after transplantation, bile salt secretion increased more rapidly than phospholipid secretion, resulting in high biliary bile salt/phospholipid ratio (BA/PL). In parallel with this, mRNA levels of the bile salt transporters NTCP and BSEP increased significantly after transplantation, whereas phospholipid translocator MDR3 mRNA levels remained unchanged. Bile duct injury correlated significantly with bile salt secretion and was associated with a high biliary BA/PL ratio.",

Genistein is a soy-derived isoflavone with pleiotropic biological effects that can enhance the antitumor effect of chemotherapeutic agents. To understand how genistein potentiates the antitumor effects of 5-FU, we examined apoptosis and autophagy in MIA PaCa-2 human pancreatic cancer cells and their derived xenografts. Apoptosis was evaluated using DNA fragmentation assays, and western blots of poly(ADP ribose)polymerase and caspase-3. Meanwhile, autophagy was evaluated using western blots of microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3)-I/II, fluorescent microscopy observation of green fluorescent protein-LC3B puncta formation, and acidic vesicular organelle formation using acridine orange staining. Tumors from animal treatment studies were examined for apoptosis and autophagy using the TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling assay and immunohistochemical staining of LC3B, respectively. We observed that genistein increased 5-FU-induced cell death through increased apoptosis, as well as autophagy. The increased autophagy was accompanied by decreased B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2) and increased beclin-1 protein levels. Animal treatment studies supported these observations. The combination of 5-FU and genistein significantly reduced final xenograft tumor volume when compared to 5-FU-alone by inducing apoptosis as well as autophagy.",

P-value and Type I error Type I error (alpha error) occur when the null hypothesis is true but is rejected erroneously, which leads to an erroneous conclusion that a difference exists between the two samples. If a test has statistic with a p-value of less than 0.05, it is accepted as statistically significant and the null hypothesis is rejected. In this situation, approximately 5% of the time type I error is made because if no difference actually exists between groups, that result will occur by chance in 5% (1 in 20 times). How is it possible ? It has already been explained that p value is 0.5 means that there is 5% chance of null hypothesis being true and 95% chance of being false; and if a study results have p value of S 0.5 the null hypothesis is rejected and the difference between groups is considered as statistically significant. So, there are 5% chances that null hypothesis is true but rejected --> Type I error. So, p-value tells about the probability of type I error (i.e., rejection of null hypothesis when it is true) If, p-value is 5 0.001 a type 1 error will occur 0.1% of the time (1 in 1000 times) Therefore, chance of making a type I error is decreased if you use a lower p value.

These novel genes are thought to contribute to distinct phenotypes that distinguish organisms. The creation, evolution, and function of duplicated genes are well-studied; however, the genesis and early evolution of novel genes are not well-characterized. We developed a computational approach to investigate these issues by integrating genome-wide comparative phylogenetic analysis with functional and interaction data derived from small-scale and high-throughput experiments. We examine the function and evolution of new genes in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We observed significant differences in the functional attributes and interactions of genes created at different times and by different mechanisms. Novel genes are initially less integrated into cellular networks than duplicate genes, but they appear to gain functions and interactions more quickly than duplicates. Recently created duplicated genes show evidence of adapting existing functions to environmental changes, while young novel genes do not exhibit enrichment for any particular functions. Finally, we found a significant preference for genes to interact with other genes of similar age and origin.",

HCC cell lines (PLC5, Huh-7, Sk-Hep1, and Hep3B) were treated with sorafenib, radiation, or both, and apoptosis and signal transduction were analyzed. All 4 HCC cell lines showed resistance to radiation-induced apoptosis; however, this resistance could be reversed in the presence of sorafenib. Inhibition of phospho-STAT3 was found in cells treated with sorafenib or sorafenib plus radiation and subsequently reduced the expression levels of STAT3-related proteins, Mcl-1, cyclin D1, and survivin. Silencing STAT3 by RNA interference overcame apoptotic resistance to radiation in HCC cells, and the ectopic expression of STAT3 in HCC cells abolished the radiosensitizing effect of sorafenib.

Therefore, option A is not the correct answer.\n\nOption B: Aflatoxin\nAflatoxin is produced by certain types of fungi, primarily Aspergillus species, that can contaminate crops such as peanuts and corn. Chronic exposure to aflatoxin is a known risk factor for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma, a type of liver cancer. However, hepatocellular adenoma is not typically associated with aflatoxin exposure. Therefore, option B is not the correct answer.\n\nOption C: Oral contraceptive pills\nOral contraceptive pills contain synthetic hormones, including estrogen and progestin, which can have various effects on the body, including the liver. One of the known risks associated with long-term oral contraceptive use is the development of hepatocellular adenoma. The estrogen component of oral contraceptives is thought to be the main factor contributing to the development of adenomas in the liver. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.\n\nOption D: Smoking\nSmoking is a known risk factor for the development of several types of cancer, including lung, throat, and bladder cancer. However, smoking is not specifically associated with the development of hepatocellular adenoma. Therefore, option D is not the correct answer.\n###Answer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.",

As the most proximal sensor of DNA variation, RNA abundance can help identify subpopulations of genetic variants active in and across tissues mediating CAD risk through gene expression. By generating new genomic data on DNA and RNA samples from the Stockholm Atherosclerosis Gene Expression (STAGE) study, 8156 cis-acting expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) for 6450 genes across 7 CAD-relevant tissues were detected. The inherited risk enrichments of tissue-defined sets of these eQTLs were assessed using 2 independent genome-wide association data sets. eQTLs acting across increasing numbers of tissues were found increasingly enriched for CAD risk and resided at regulatory hot spots. The risk enrichment of 42 eQTLs acting across 5 to 6 tissues was particularly high (\u22647.3-fold) and confirmed in the combined genome-wide association data from Coronary Artery Disease Genome Wide Replication And Meta-Analysis Consortium. Sixteen of the 42 eQTLs associated with 19 master regulatory genes and 29 downstream gene sets (n>30) were further risk enriched comparable to that of the 153 genome-wide association risk single-nucleotide polymorphisms established for CAD (8.4-fold versus 10-fold).

Although this method has been used in Drosophila, it has been limited to studies of embryonic gene function. Only inefficient effects have been seen at later stages of development. When expressed under the control of a heat-inducible promoter, dsRNA interfered efficiently and specifically with gene expression during larval and prepupal development in Drosophila. Expression of dsRNA corresponding to the EcR ecdysone receptor gene generated defects in larval molting and metamorphosis, resulting in animals that failed to pupariate or prepupae that died with defects in larval tissue cell death and adult leg formation. In contrast, expression of dsRNA corresponding to the coding region of the betaFTZ-F1 orphan nuclear receptor had no effect on puparium formation, but led to an arrest of prepupal development, generating more severe lethal phenotypes than those seen with a weak betaFTZ-F1 loss-of-function allele. Animals that expressed either EcR or betaFTZ-F1 dsRNA showed defects in the expression of corresponding target genes, indicating that the observed developmental defects are caused by disruption of the genetic cascades that control the onset of metamorphosis.",

Microglia respond to a multitude of soluble molecules produced by a variety of brain cells. Macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) is a cytokine found in the brain whose receptor is expressed by microglia. Previous studies suggest a critical role for M-CSF in brain development and normal functioning as well as in several disease processes involving neuroinflammation. Using biopsy tissue from patients with intractable temporal epilepsy and autopsy tissue, we cultured primary adult human microglia to investigate their response to M-CSF. Mixed glial cultures were treated with 25 ng/ml M-CSF for 96 hours. Proliferation and phagocytosis assays, and high through-put immunocytochemistry, microscopy and image analysis were performed to investigate microglial phenotype and function. We found that the phenotype of primary adult human microglia was markedly changed following exposure to M-CSF. A greater number of microglia were present in the M-CSF- treated cultures as the percentage of proliferating (BrdU and Ki67-positive) microglia was greatly increased. A number of changes in protein expression occurred following M-CSF treatment, including increased transcription factors PU.1 and C/EBP\u03b2, increased DAP12 adaptor protein, increased M-CSF receptor (CSF-1R) and IGF-1 receptor, and reduced HLA-DP, DQ, DR antigen presentation protein.

Although SSTR2 expression is a good predictor for biochemical response to SSA treatment, we still face tumors resistant to SSAs despite high SSTR2 expression. Recently, beta-arrestins (\u03b2-arrestins) have been highlighted as key players in the regulation of SSTR2 function. To investigate whether \u03b2-arrestins might be useful predictors of responsiveness to long-term SSA treatment in acromegaly, we retrospectively evaluated 35 patients with acromegaly who underwent adenomectomy in two referral centers in The Netherlands. \u03b2-arrestin mRNA levels were evaluated in adenoma samples, together with SSTR2 (and SSTR5) mRNA and protein expression. Biochemical response to long-term SSA treatment (median 12 months) was assessed in 32 patients. \u03b2-arrestin 1 and 2 mRNA was significantly lower in adenoma tissues from patients who achieved insulin-like growth factor 1 normalization (P = 0.024 and P = 0.047) and complete biochemical control (P = 0.047 and P = 0.039).

        "output": "###Rationale:\nOption A: Inferior frontal gyrus\nThe inferior frontal gyrus, specifically Broca's area (located in the dominant hemisphere), is primarily involved in expressive language and speech production. Lesions in this area typically result in non-fluent aphasia, characterized by difficulty in articulating words and forming sentences. This patient's presentation does not align with the expected deficits of inferior frontal gyrus involvement, as her speech is fluent and she exhibits paraphasic errors. Therefore, option A is unlikely to be the correct answer.\n\nOption B: Superior temporal gyrus\nThe superior temporal gyrus, particularly Wernicke's area (located in the dominant hemisphere), is responsible for comprehension of language and speech. Lesions in this area can cause receptive aphasia, characterized by impaired comprehension and fluent but meaningless speech. This patient's symptoms, including impaired comprehension, paraphasic errors, and fluent but meaningless speech, suggest involvement of the superior temporal gyrus and align with the expected deficits of Wernicke's area. Therefore, option B is the most likely correct answer.\n\nOption C: Arcuate fasciculus, inferior frontal gyrus, and superior temporal gyrus\nThe arcuate fasciculus is a white matter tract that connects Broca's area with Wernicke's area. Damage to the arcuate fasciculus can result in conduction aphasia, which is characterized by intact comprehension, fluent speech, but impaired repetition. While the patient's impaired repetition could suggest arcuate fasciculus involvement, her other symptoms do not align with the classic presentation of conduction aphasia. Additionally, the involvement of both inferior frontal gyrus and superior temporal gyrus is not necessary to explain her symptoms. Therefore, option C is unlikely to be the correct answer.\n\nOption D: Frontal lobe, sparing Broadmann's area 44 and 45\nThis option suggests a lesion in the frontal lobe but excludes damage to Broca's area (Broadmann's area 44 and 45). Lesions in the frontal lobe can result in various cognitive and motor deficits, but it is less likely to specifically cause the language impairment seen in this patient. Additionally, excluding involvement of Broca's area does not fully explain her symptoms, as her speech is fluent with paraphasic errors. Therefore, option D is unlikely to be the correct answer.\n###Answer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.",

However, there is no information in the question stem to suggest that the patient has hypothyroidism or any symptoms consistent with it. Therefore, levothyroxine is not the most appropriate initial step in treatment.\n\nOption B: Hyperbaric oxygen\nHyperbaric oxygen therapy is a treatment in which a patient breathes 100% oxygen while inside a pressurized chamber. It is used to treat a variety of medical conditions, but there is no information in the question stem to suggest that the patient would benefit from this treatment. Additionally, the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are not consistent with any condition that would require hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Therefore, this is not the most appropriate initial step in treatment.\n\nOption C: Deferoxamine\nDeferoxamine is a medication used to treat iron overdose or iron poisoning. There is no information in the question stem to suggest that the patient has been exposed to excessive amounts of iron or is suffering from iron poisoning. Therefore, deferoxamine is not the most appropriate initial step in treatment.\n\nOption D: Glucocorticoids\nGlucocorticoids are a type of steroid medication that have anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects. They can be used to treat a wide range of conditions, including autoimmune diseases and inflammatory conditions. In this case, the patient's symptoms of fatigue, weight loss, decreased energy, loose stools, and abdominal pain are concerning for an underlying inflammatory condition or autoimmune disease. In addition, the presence of tanned skin and bluish-black gums suggests a condition called Addison's disease, which is a primary adrenal insufficiency often caused by autoimmune destruction of the adrenal glands. The patient's low blood pressure and electrolyte abnormalities (hyponatremia and hyperkalemia) further support this diagnosis. Glucocorticoids are the mainstay of treatment for Addison's disease, and initiating glucocorticoid therapy is the most appropriate initial step in treatment for this patient.\n###Answer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.",

We aimed to investigate the effects of corticotrophin-releasing hormone knockout (CRH KO) on the innate immune responses in macrophages as well as to elucidate the underlying mechanism. The chemotaxis and phagocytosis activities of macrophages, bacteria translocation, plasma tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 secretion, and intestinal injury were observed in the presence of the endoplasmic reticulum stress after thermal injury in CRH KO mice. Meanwhile, the messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expression of glucose response protein 78 (GRP78), X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1), and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) in macrophages was also determined. After thermal injury, the chemotaxis and phagocytosis of peritoneal macrophages were increased, which were both reversed by CRH gene deficiency. The gut-derived bacteria translocation to liver tissues, lung tissues and mesenteric lymph nodes was significantly strengthened in CRH KO mice compared with CRH wild-type littermates. Circulating TNF-\u03b1 level was increased markedly in response to thermal injury and CRH KO further increased its secretion. Furthermore, the mRNA and protein levels of GRP78, XBP1, and ATF6 in peritoneal macrophages increased, while their expressions in CRH KO mice all decreased significantly.

Recent data suggest that maternal body mass index (BMI) could have an influence. Our objective was to determine whether an association exists between maternal prepregnancy BMI category and occurrence of NH among infants born to women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). This was a retrospective study including all GDM pregnancies delivered between 1986 and 2006 at a tertiary care center (Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Barcelona). PATIENTS AND OUTCOMES: GDM was diagnosed using universal screening and National Diabetes Data Group criteria. Two thousand ninety-two newborns (1925 singletons, 85% of total GDM offspring) were studied. NH was defined according to Cornblath criteria. In addition to maternal BMI, we considered other variables such as glucose values at diagnosis or third-trimester glycated hemoglobin as potential predictors of NH. We explored whether the association between maternal BMI and NH could be due to intermediate steps such as cesarean section or abnormal birth weight. The rate of NH was 3%. In the bivariate analysis, prepregnancy BMI was higher in the NH group (24.45 vs. 23.19 kg/m(2), P < 0.02). In the logistic regression analysis, prepregnancy BMI of at least 25 kg/m(2) was independently associated with NH whether the analysis included intermediate variables (odds ratio = 2.11; 95% confidence interval = 1.10-4.03) or not (odds ratio = 2.66; 95% confidence interval = 1.44-4.92).",

Currently, the factors that modulate odontoblast TLR2 activation are unknown. Our aim was to investigate lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP) effects on the\u00a0TLR2-mediated odontoblast response. Human odontoblast-like cells were stimulated with lipoteichoic acid (LTA) (a TLR2 ligand), LBP, CD14 (a TLR2 cofactor), or various combinations of LTA/LBP, LTA/CD14, or LTA/CD14/LBP. CXCL8, IL6, and TLR2 gene expression was assessed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. CXCL8 and interleukin (IL)-6 production was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in culture supernatants of cells stimulated with LTA, LTA/CD14, or LTA/CD14/LBP. LBP effects on nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB), p38, JNK, ERK, STAT3, and p70S6 signaling pathways were determined in LTA-stimulated odontoblast-like cells with a multiplex biometric immunoassay. LBP effects were compared with specific inhibitors of these signaling pathways.

Activation of CXCL8, IL6, and TLR2 gene expression and CXCL8 and IL-6 secretion in LTA- and LTA/CD14-stimulated odontoblast-like cells was significantly decreased by LBP. LBP inhibited NF-\u03baB and p38 signaling pathways in LTA-stimulated cells in a similar way to NF-\u03baB and p38 inhibitors.

The purposes of this study were to examine the effects of ivabradine (IBD) on cardiac function and plasma NE and BNP-45 after chronic ischemic heart failure (CHF) in non-diabetic rats and diabetic rats. We further determined if sympathetic NE uptake-1 (a major pathway to metabolize NE) mechanism is responsible for the role played by IBD. We ligated rat's coronary artery to induce CHF; and injected streptozotocin (STZ) to induce diabetic hyperglycemia. Echocardiography was employed to determine cardiac function. We used ELISA to examine plasma NE and BNP-45; and Western Blot analysis to examine the protein levels of NE uptake-1 in sympathetic nerves. CHF increased the levels of NE and BNP-45 in non-STZ rats and STZ rats. Systemic injection of IBD significantly attenuated the augmented NE and BNP-45 and impaired left ventricular function induced by CHF in those rats. This effect appeared to be less in STZ rats. A liner relation was observed between the NE/BNP-45 levels and left ventricular function after administration of IBD. Also, IBD was observed to have a recovery effect on the downregulated NE uptake-1 evoked by CHF, but to a smaller degree in STZ rats.",

        "input": "###Question: Does cross-species transcriptional network analysis reveal conservation and variation in response to metal stress in cyanobacteria?\n###Context: As one of the most dominant bacterial groups on Earth, cyanobacteria play a pivotal role in the global carbon cycling and the Earth atmosphere composition. Understanding their molecular responses to environmental perturbations has important scientific and environmental values. Since important biological processes or networks are often evolutionarily conserved, the cross-species transcriptional network analysis offers a useful strategy to decipher conserved and species-specific transcriptional mechanisms that cells utilize to deal with various biotic and abiotic disturbances, and it will eventually lead to a better understanding of associated adaptation and regulatory networks. In this study, the Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) approach was used to establish transcriptional networks for four important cyanobacteria species under metal stress, including iron depletion and high copper conditions. Cross-species network comparison led to discovery of several core response modules and genes possibly essential to metal stress, as well as species-specific hub genes for metal stresses in different cyanobacteria species, shedding light on survival strategies of cyanobacteria responding to different environmental perturbations.",

A remaining challenge in child passenger safety is to reach the Healthy People 2010 objective of child safety seat use to 100%. Several factors have been reported to influence child safety seat use. A child safety seat Hassles Scale was developed to explore hassles that are associated with child safety seat nonuse. Focus groups with violators of the California Child Passenger Safety Law provided data to construct the 29-item Hassles Scale. The scale was used in an interview that was conducted with 132 parents who were cited for violation of the law and whose children were 12 to 47 months of age and weighed 20 to 40 pounds. Interviews were conducted 3 months after parents paid the fine for the citation. Each hassle was rated 0 to 3 on frequency and intensity. Parent report of child safety seat use was obtained. Factor analysis was used to construct subscales. Relationship of subscale frequency and intensity scores to reported child safety seat use was assessed with linear regression. The sample was 86% Latino, 45% Spanish-speaking, and 55% with income < dollar 30000. Thirty-one percent of the parents reported that the child did not now always use a child safety seat. Four subscales were identified: child, crowding/inconvenience, busy, and vehicle. Only the frequency of the child subscale items (eg, resists, gets out of seat) and the frequency and the intensity of the crowding/inconvenience subscale items (eg, child safety seat takes up too much room, too many passengers) were related to child safety seat nonuse. Sixty-nine percent agreement with parent report of child safety seat use was achieved using only the frequency scores for the 9 items in the 2 subscales child and crowding/inconvenience, compared with 65% for the 29-item scale.",

We hypothesised that if tumour cell dissemination occurs with EUS-FNA, survival after complete resection would be impaired. We aimed to evaluate the association of preoperative EUS-FNA with long-term outcomes of patients with resected pancreatic cancer. Using the linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare data, we identified patients with locoregional pancreatic cancer who underwent curative intent surgery from 1998 to 2009. The patients who received EUS-FNA within the peridiagnostic period were included in the EUS-FNA group. Patients who did not receive EUS evaluation or who underwent EUS without FNA were included in the non-EUS-FNA group. Overall survival and pancreatic cancer-specific survival were compared after controlling for relevant covariates. A total of 2034 patients with pancreatic cancer were included (90% pancreatic adenocarcinoma). Of these, 498 (24%) patients were in EUS-FNA group. Patients with multiple comorbidities and more recent diagnosis were more likely to receive EUS-FNA. In multivariate analysis, after controlling for age, race, gender, tumour histology, tumour stage, tumour grade, tumour location, SEER site, year of diagnosis, undergoing percutaneous aspiration/biopsy, Charlson Comorbidity Index, radiation and chemotherapy, EUS-FNA was marginally associated with improved overall survival (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.99), but did not affect cancer-specific survival (HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.03).",

Blood samples were collected from 61 HCC and 29 cirrhotic patients, and 30 healthy individuals. Circulating RNA was extracted from plasma of all samples. The mRNA for MCM6 were amplified and quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Plasma MCM6 and \u03b1-fetoprotein (AFP) protein levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In HCC patients, MCM6 mRNA and protein levels were significantly increased over the cirrhotic and healthy controls. The levels of MCM6 mRNA and protein in the plasma of HCC patients correlated to vascular invasion (P\u2009<\u20090.01). Higher MCM6 protein levels also correlated with tumor stage progression and lymph node metastasis. The MCM6 protein has sensitivity of 67.2% and specificity of 89.8% in differentiating total HCC from non-HCC individuals.

Despite their distinct aetiology and clinical aspects, these diseases share several immunological features. Besides the largely documented role of T cells, emerging literature supports a potential involvement of innate immune effectors, the natural killer (NK) cells, in both pathologies. In the peripheral blood, NK cells consist of CD3-CD56dim and CD3-CD56bright cell subsets, harbouring a distinct cell surface phenotype, but both endowed with the main NK-cell effector functions: cytotoxicity and cytokine production. To determine whether the frequency, the cell surface phenotype and the functional properties of peripheral NK cells were affected in patients with psoriasis or atopic dermatitis. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from 11 patients with psoriasis, nine patients with atopic dermatitis and 16 healthy individuals. By using flow cytometry, we analysed the following parameters of peripheral NK cells: the frequency, the cell surface expression of several NK-cell receptors (NKR) and the activation of the effector functions upon various in vitro stimuli. Peripheral NK cells were significantly reduced in both skin diseases. The cell surface expression of various NKR was differently modified in peripheral NK cells of the two cohorts of patients. Finally, NK-cell natural cytotoxicity was affected only in atopic dermatitis, while interferon-\u03b3 production was defective in both groups of patients.",

We determined if alpha(1D) adrenergic receptors are expressed in the urothelium of the rat bladder and if inhibition of these receptors affects reflex voiding. Female Wistar rats were used in the experiments. Receptor expression was evaluated by Western blot. The effects of receptor activation were studied using cystometrograms, measurement of adenosine triphosphate concentrations in the bladder lumen and afferent nerve recording. The alpha(1D) antagonist naftopidil (0.75 to 1.66 mg/kg) was administered intravenously into the external jugular vein. The expression of alpha(1D) adrenergic receptors was detected in urothelial tissue with Western blot and immunohistochemistry. The alpha(1D) receptor antagonist naftopidil prolonged the intercontraction interval during continuous infusion cystometrograms in conscious rats (143% of the control value) and suppressed the excitatory effect of intravesical infusion of acetic acid (0.1%) on the intercontraction interval (220%).

It suggests a possible link between the migration/invasion potential of oral cancer cells and the prevalent expression of HDAC2. Five head and neck cancer (HNC) cell lines, including Ca9-22, Cal-27, HSC-3, SAS, and TW2.6, were used. Cells stably overexpressing HDAC2 and shRNA against HDAC2 were established to investigate migration/invasion ability in vitro and tumorigenesis and progression in vivo. We found that alterations in the HDAC2 level in OSCC cell lines modulated their invasive ability with a positive correlation. Animal model also showed that knockdown of HDAC2 expression in SAS cells, originally containing high endogenous HDAC2 expression, resulted in decrease in tumor initiation and progression. Using high-throughput transcriptome analysis, numerous genes involved in HIF-1\u03b1-associated pathways were found. At the mechanism levels, using agents to block de novo protein synthesis or prevent protein degradation by ubiquitination, we found the stability of hypoxia inducible factor 1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) protein was maintained in OSCC cells with HDAC2 overexpression. In addition, co-immunoprecipitation assay also revealed that HDAC2-mediated HIF-1\u03b1 protein stability is because of direct interaction of HIF-1\u03b1 with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein.",

However, most studies on the health implications of Neu5Ac have focused on its effects on the nervous system, while its effects on cardiovascular risk factors have largely been unreported. Thus, the effects of Neu5Ac on coagulation status in high fat diet (HFD)-induced hyperlipidemic rats were evaluated in this study. Sprague Dawley male rats were divided into five different groups and fed with HFD alone, HFD low-dose Neu5Ac, HFD high-dose Neu5Ac, HFD simvastatin (10\u2008mg/kg day), and normal pellet alone. Food was given ad libitum while body weight of rats was measured weekly. After 12 weeks of intervention, rats were sacrificed and serum and tissue samples were collected for biochemistry and gene expression analysis, respectively.

Forty guinea pigs were assigned to one of four groups: HS+NOISE (i.p. injection hydrogen-rich saline), NS+NOISE (i.p. injection normal saline), NOISE ALONE (noise control), and NO TREATMENT (normal control) groups. The HS+NOISE, NS+NOISE, and NOISE ALONE groups were exposed to intensive noise (4 h at 115 dB SPL noise of 4000\u00b1100 Hz). The auditory brainstem response (ABR) was used to examine the hearing threshold in each group. Distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) was used to examine outer hair cell function. We also examined cochlear morphology to evaluate inner and outer hair cell trauma induced by noise exposure. Hydrogen-rich saline was administered twice daily for 6 days (2.5 ml/kg, i.p.) 24 h after noise exposure. Baseline ABR thresholds and DPOAE values were normal in all groups at the measured frequencies (2, 4, 8, and 16 kHz) before noise exposure. The ABR threshold shift was 50-55 dB across the frequencies tested, and average DPOAE declined in the NOISE ALONE, NS+NOISE, and HS+NOISE groups 24 h after noise exposure. However, the changes in cochlear parameters were different between groups. The HS+NOISE group showed a significantly decreased ABR threshold value as compared with the NS+NOISE or NOISE ALONE group (P<0.01) on day 7. The mean DPOAE recovered to some extent in the three noise exposure groups, but at most frequencies the HS+NOISE group showed significantly increased DPOAE on day 7 as compared with the NS+NOISE group or NOISE ALONE group (P<0.01). Surface Corti organ preparations stained with succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) showed that most outer hair cells (OHCs) were still dropsical and a few were missing 7 days after noise exposure in the NS+NOISE group. Only a few OHCs were slightly dropsical in the HS+NOISE group. The numbers of missing hair cells 7 days after noise exposure were significantly greater in the NOISE ONLY and NS+NOISE groups than the HS+NOISE group (P<0.01).",

Traditional approaches for identifying antioxidant molecules in foods, such as total phenolic compound (TP) content or oxygen radical absorption capacity (ORAC), do not measure capacity to activate AREs. The goal of this study was to develop an assay to assess the ARE activation capacity of fruit and vegetable extracts and determine whether such capacity was predicted by TP content and/or ORAC activity. Fruits and vegetables were homogenized, extracted with acidified ethanol, lyophilized, and resuspended in growth medium. Human IMR-32 neuroblastoma cells, transfected with an ARE-firefly luciferase reporter, were exposed to extracts for 5 h. Firefly luciferase was normalized to constitutively expressed Renilla luciferase with tertiary butylhydroquinone (tBHQ) as a positive control. TP content and ORAC activity were measured for each extract. Relations between TPs and ORAC and ARE activity were determined. A total of 107 of 134 extracts tested significantly activated the ARE-luciferase reporter from 1.2- to 58-fold above that of the solvent control (P < 0.05) in human IMR-32 cells. ARE activity, TP content, and ORAC ranked higher in peels than in associated flesh. Despite this relation, ARE activity did not correlate with TP content (Spearman \u03c1 = 0.05, P = 0.57) and only modestly but negatively correlated with ORAC (Spearman \u03c1 = -0.24, P < 0.01).

However, the optimal cooling method (surface vs. intravascular) has not yet been specified. Substantial heart disease is present in most of these patients and therefore haemodynamic effects of cooling need to be considered very carefully. We analysed the haemodynamic response to TTM in patients treated with surface versus intravascular cooling following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. In this observational study 63 consecutive subjects presenting to the hospital after successful resuscitation following of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest received an intravascular (40 patients) or external cooling device (23 patients) to induce TTM. While with intravascular cooling the target temperature of 33 degrees C was reached after 159 minutes, the minimum temperature achieved with surface cooling was about 35 degrees C after 437 minutes. Haemodynamic parameters were recorded in a 4-hour rhythm for the first 12 hours after induction of hypothermia. Generally, TTM of 33 degrees C resulted in a higher systemic vascular resistance index (749 vs. 467 dyn*sec/cms/m2; P= 0.04) but also in a marked reduction of heart rate (67.70 vs. 100.00 bpm; P < 0.001), a higher mixed venous oxygen saturation (76 vs. 68%; P = 0.016), and a higher stroke volume index (45 vs. 33 mI/m2; P = 0.036).

To date, few studies have assessed the role of symmetric dimethyl-arginine (SDMA) in patients with peripheral arterial disease. We aimed to determine the relationship, if any, of SDMA to all-cause mortality and disease severity as assessed by the ankle-brachial index (ABI) in patients with symptomatic peripheral arterial disease (PAD). In 238 patients with symptomatic PAD and an ABI of <0.8, l-arginine, asymmetric dimethyl-arginine (ADMA) and SDMA levels were measured by hydrophilic-interaction liquid chromatography-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry. The median follow-up was 6 years 11 months (interquartile range [IQR], 4 years 5 months-7 years 10 months). SDMA and ADMA levels were higher in those who died compared with those who survived (0.51 [IQR, 0.44-0.66] \u03bcmol/L vs 0.46 [IQR, 0.39-0.55] \u03bcmol/L, P \u2264 .001; and 0.48 [IQR, 0.41-0.55] \u03bcmol/L vs 0.45 [IQR, 0.39-0.50] \u03bcmol/L, P = .007, respectively). l-arginine levels were similar in the two groups.

Amisulpride has also been demonstrated to be an antidepressant for patients with major depression in many clinical trials. In part because of the selective D(2)/D(3) receptor antagonist properties of amisulpride, it has long been widely assumed that dopaminergic modulation is the proximal event responsible for mediating its antidepressant and antipsychotic properties. The purpose of these studies was to determine if amisulpride's antidepressant actions are mediated by off-target interactions with other receptors. We performed experiments that: (1) examined the pharmacological profile of amisulpride at a large number of central nervous system (CNS) molecular targets and, (2) after finding high potency antagonist affinity for human 5-HT(7a) serotonin receptors, characterized the actions of amisulpride as an antidepressant in wild-type and 5-HT(7) receptor knockout mice. We discovered that amisulpride was a potent competitive antagonist at 5-HT(7a) receptors and that interactions with no other molecular target investigated in this paper could explain its antidepressant actions in vivo. Significantly, and in contrast to their wild-type littermates, 5-HT(7) receptor knockout mice did not respond to amisulpride in two widely used rodent models of depression, the tail suspension test and the forced swim test.",

        "output": "###Rationale:\nOption A: Opsonization\nOpsonization is the process by which pathogens are marked for phagocytosis by immune cells, usually through the binding of antibodies or complement proteins. Opsonization does not directly play a role in the tuberculin skin test reaction. Therefore, option A is not involved in the skin test reaction.\n\nOption B: Complement Activation\nComplement activation is a part of the immune response that involves a series of proteins that can help to destroy invading pathogens. While complement activation can be involved in various immune reactions, it is not directly involved in the tuberculin skin test reaction. Thus, option B is not involved in the skin test reaction.\n\nOption C: Th1-mediated cytotoxicity\nThe tuberculin skin test is an example of a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction, mediated by T lymphocytes (specifically Th1 cells) rather than antibodies. Following the injection of tuberculin into the skin, Th1 cells recognize the antigens in the tuberculin, leading to the release of inflammatory cytokines. This reaction causes recruitment and clumping of macrophages, leading to induration and redness at the injection site. Therefore, option C, Th1-mediated cytotoxicity, is involved in the skin test reaction.\n\nOption D: IgE cross-linking\nIgE cross-linking is involved in type I hypersensitivity reactions, such as allergic reactions mediated by mast cells and basophils. The tuberculin skin test does not involve IgE-mediated reactions, so option D is not involved in the skin test reaction.\n###Answer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.",

One approach is to employ forward genetic screens in genetically tractable model organisms. In Drosophila melanogaster, P element-mediated insertional mutagenesis is a versatile tool for the dissection of molecular pathways, and there is an ongoing effort to tag every gene with a P element insertion. However, the vast majority of P element insertion lines are viable and fertile as homozygotes and do not exhibit obvious phenotypic defects, perhaps because of the tendency for P elements to insert 5' of transcription units. Quantitative genetic analysis of subtle effects of P element mutations that have been induced in an isogenic background may be a highly efficient method for functional genome annotation. Here, we have tested the efficacy of this strategy by assessing the extent to which screening for quantitative effects of P elements on sensory bristle number can identify genes affecting neural development. We find that such quantitative screens uncover an unusually large number of genes that are known to function in neural development, as well as genes with yet uncharacterized effects on neural development, and novel loci.",

Rods and aggregates of the actin-associated protein cofilin are abundant in grey matter of postmortem AD brain and rods are found inside neurites in animal and cell models of AD. We sought further understanding of the significance of cofilin rods/aggregates to the disease process: Do rods/aggregates correlate with AD progression and the development of hallmark neurofibrillary tangles and neuropil threads? Are cofilin rods/aggregates found in the same neurites as hyperphosphorylated tau? The specificity of rods/aggregates to AD compared with general aging and their spatial relationship to tau protein was examined in postmortem human hippocampus, inferior temporal cortex, and anterior cingulate cortex. The presence of cofilin rods/aggregates correlated with the extent of tau pathology independent of patient age. Densities of rods/aggregates were fourfold greater in AD compared with aged-matched control brains and rods/aggregates were significantly larger in AD brain. We did not find evidence for our hypothesis that intracellular cofilin rods are localized to tau-positive neuropil threads. Instead, data suggest the involvement of microglia in the clearance of cofilin rods/aggregates and/or in their synthesis in and around amyloid plaques and surrounding neuropil.",

MA-PD plans have been increasing their adherence intervention efforts as an approach to improving beneficiaries' medication adherence and the plan's quality performance ratings. However, few evaluations have examined the effects of these interventions on medication adherence and performance ratings. To assess the impact of a quasi-experimental multichannel adherence intervention on beneficiaries' medication adherence and health plan quality performance measures for 2 MA-PD plans. The intervention included a daily prescriber-directed 90-day retail refill component and a weekly member-directed refill reminder component. Members filling 1 or more medications assessed by the 3 CMS star ratings adherence measures (oral antidiabetics [DM], antihypertensives [HTN], and statins [CHOL]) were identified for a 2-component intervention starting in April 2013. The retail-based 90-day refill component sent populated 90-day prescription letters via fax to prescribers of members who had filled a 30-day prescription. One fax per member-medication instance was sent and included the option to fax approval of a new 90-day prescription. For prescribers who approved, members were notified that a 90-day refill was available at their retail pharmacies. The refill reminder component used weekly scans of pharmacy claims to identify members' refill patterns. Reminder letters were sent to members 7 days late to refill. An intent-to-treat approach was used to assess intervention effectiveness. Pharmacy claims and health plan enrollment data were used to calculate adherence among members enrolled 1 year pre- and postintervention start (April 2013) for the intervention group and a comparator group that consisted of 4 MA-PD plans not implementing an adherence intervention. Adherence was estimated by the proportion of days covered (PDC) and generalized linear models were fit to calculate difference-in-difference (DID) estimators to control for demographics, comorbidity, and changes in adherence over the study period. To estimate the impact of the intervention on health plan quality performance, 2013 and 2014 CMS star ratings for the respective 2012 and 2013 measurement years were compared by group. During the first year of the intervention, 1,344 prescribers representing 6,701 members were faxed 15,284 populated prescription letters. Prescriber response rate was 53.7% and approval rate (approved letters of total sent) was 47.3%. An average of 539 refill reminder letters were sent per week. DID estimators showed positive influence of the intervention on adherence to HTN and CHOL. For the intervention group, adherence increased 2.0 percentage points (P < 0.001) for HTN and 1.8 percentage points (P < 0.001) for CHOL, relative to the control group. The odds of achieving adherence (PDC \u2265 80%) were greater in the intervention group compared with control for HTN (ratio of odds ratio [ROR] = 1.334; 95% CI = 1.203-1.479) and for CHOL (ROR = 1.247; 95% CI = 1.132-1.374). For the 2 plans implementing the intervention, CMS-published adherence rates for DM, HTN, and CHOL increased from 2012 to 2013 by an average 5.5, 6.0, and 7.0 percentage points, respectively, compared with the control group (3.5, 2.0, and 1.8 percentage points, respectively).",

Prospective examination of 12 eyes with bacterial corneal ulcers (group 1) and 12 control eyes (group 2). Infrared thermal imaging (Tomey TG 1000) was used to study the temperature of the ocular surface. The mean, minimum and maximum temperature of the ocular surface and temperature course over a time period of 10 s of sustained eye opening were evaluated. Furthermore, a correlation between the overall corneal temperature and the temperature at the base of the corneal ulcers was determined. A significant difference between both groups was present. Mean corneal temperature was 35.6\u00b0C \u00b1 0.9 in group 1 and 34.8\u00b0C \u00b1 0.8 in group 2 (p = 0.033).

But all of these data had been obtained in adult populations and whether this protection was maintained in aging kidneys was unknown. The objective of this study was to establish whether the efficacy of IPoC is maintained in aging kidneys. The aged (24-month-old) and young (3-month-old) Wistar rats were used. Rats were subjected to 45\u2009min of renal ischemia, both with and without treatment with IPoC. Serum urea nitrogen and creatinine levels, histological examination and apoptosis were assessed at 24\u2009h. Oxidative stress was evaluated and apoptosis-related molecules were studied by Western blotting. In young rat kidneys, IPoC significantly attenuated the renal dysfunction and cell apoptosis induced by I/R.

In patients with heart failure due to cardiomyopathy or to valve diseases with volume or pressure overload, or both, myocardial adrenergic nerve activity is accelerated independent of underlying cause. However, it is not clear whether this change in myocardial adrenergic nerve activity is present in patients without left ventricular volume or pressure overload. The study patients were 20 men and women with normal left ventricular function and heart failure due to mitral stenosis. Planar MIBG images obtained from these patients were compared with images from nine age-matched healthy subjects (control group). Myocardial uptake of MIBG was calculated as the heart/mediastinal activity ratio. Storage and release of MIBG were calculated as percent myocardial MIBG washout from 15 min to 4 h after isotope injection. All 20 study patients underwent echocardiography, and 16 underwent right heart catheterization. The heart/mediastinal activity ratio in the immediate images (15 min) did not show any significant difference between the patient and control groups.

However, the molecular context in which this effect is mediated has yet to be determined. We investigated the potential molecular network for FTO by analyzing co-expression and protein-protein interaction databases, Coxpresdb and IntAct, as well as the functional coupling predicting multi-source database, FunCoup.

We tried to identify factors that predict peritoneal recurrence with high sensitivity. Clinical and pathologic data from 587 consecutive patients with gastric cancer were reviewed retrospectively. The stepwise Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to assess the prognostic significance of the magnitude of serosal changes. Multiple stepwise logistic regression analysis was used to determine factors associated with peritoneal recurrence in 375 patients who underwent curative resection. The 5-year survival rate of patients with S2 disease (greatest dimension of macroscopic serosal changes >/= 2.5 cm) was 18%, which was worse than S0 (no serosal changes) and S1 disease (macroscopic serosal changes < 2.5 cm)(p < 0.001). Patients with S0 tumors who underwent curative resection had the best 5-year survival rate. Multivariate analyses indicated that the magnitude of serosal changes was an independent prognostic factor for survival both overall and after curative resection. Logistic regression analysis showed that peritoneal recurrence was more than four times as likely with S2 than with S0 or S1 tumors. The sensitivity for predicting peritoneal recurrence was 79%; the sensitivity of cytologic examination was 38%.",

This study was conducted to test whether the acute lung inflammation and damage that might occur during heatstroke could be affected by brain cooling. Anesthetized rats were randomized into four groups as follows: (a) normothermic controls (n = 8); (b) heatstroke rats without saline delivery (n = 8); (c) heatstroke rats treated with 36\u00b0C saline via retrograde jugular vein (n = 8); and (d) heatstroke rats treated with 4\u00b0C saline via retrograde jugular vein (n = 8). Heatstroke was induced by putting the animals in a folded heating pad of 42\u00b0C for 68 minutes controlled by circulating hot water. The core temperatures of normothermic groups were maintained at about 36\u00b0C. The cardiovascular parameters and core temperatures were monitored for all experiments. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was done in the left lung 20 minutes after termination of heat stress for determination of cellular ischemia markers (e.g., glutamate, lactate-to-pyruvate ratio), proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1, tumor necrosis factor-alpha), and nitric oxide metabolites. Parts of the right lung were excised for meloperoxidase measurement, whereas the rest was collected for lung damage score assessments. When compared with those of normothermic controls, untreated or 36\u00b0C saline-treated heatstroke rats had higher values of BAL fluid levels of cellular ischemia markers, proinflammatory cytokines, nitric oxide metabolites, lung meroperoxidase activity, lung damage score, and neutrophil infiltration. Brain cooling causes by 4\u00b0C saline infusion significantly reduced the heat-induced increased BAL levels of cellular ischemia markers, proinflammatory cytokines, and nitric oxide metabolites, and reduced lung damage score and neutrophil infiltration.",

Failure of initial antibiotic therapy occurred in 23% of patients. Average antibiotic treatment lasted 12.2 days; the average full cost of admission totalled euro5,530. If the initial antibiotic regimen fails to eradicate the infectious organism, the length of stay extends for 7 days and costs increase by euro2,850 per patient. Nevertheless, when taking into account the lower intensity of care during the last days of treatment, savings reduce costs to euro671 per patient.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether concomitant IVT influences the revascularization efficacy in mechanical thrombectomy (MT). This study conducted a retrospective analysis of all consecutive patients presenting with an anterior circulation stroke due to large-artery occlusion with imaging evidence who were treated with MT between July 2012 and December 2013 at 2 high-volume stroke centers. Imaging data were regraded and re-evaluated according to the modified Treatment in Cerebral Ischemia scale and its respective vessel occlusion site definitions. Clinical end points included National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and modified Rankin Scale; imaging and procedural measures were technical end points. We identified 93 patients who presented with an occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA): of these patients, 66 (71%) received IVT.

The authors demonstrated that in patients with bladder carcinoma there is a negative correlation between the levels of natural killer (NK) activity and the clinical evolution and pathologic stages of disease. The authors investigated the effect of various doses of recombinant interferon-alpha-2b (IFN-alpha-2b) for variable periods of culture on the nonmajor histocompatibility-restricted cytotoxic activity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC) with or without CD16 and CD3-depleted populations from patients with superficial (confined to the mucosa or lamina propria) and infiltrative (those infiltrating beyond the lamina propria) TCC of the bladder using 4-hour 51-sodium chromate (51Cr)-release cytotoxicity assays against both NK-sensitive (K562) and NK-resistant (JY) tumor target cells. The normal NK activity detected in PBMNC from patients with superficial TCC of the bladder can be significantly enhanced by short-term (18-hour) incubation with recombinant IFN-alpha (P < 0.05). The depressed NK cytotoxic activity found in PBMNC from patients with infiltrative TCC can also be significantly enhanced, but not normalized, by short-term (18-hour) incubation with recombinant IFN-alpha (P < 0.05).

By selection with CD16 or CD3 monoclonal antibodies and complement, it was also found that the precursor and effector lymphocytes of this recombinant IFN-alpha-promoted cytotoxicity belong to NK lineage. In kinetic studies, it was found that the maximal levels of the recombinant IFN-alpha-promoted cytotoxic activity against NK-sensitive and NK-resistant target cells in PBMNC from patients with TCC were reached after 18 hours of culture.",

Ets-1 signaling has also been linked to the development of a basal-like breast cancer phenotype. We recently described a nitric oxide (NO)-induced gene signature that is associated with poor disease outcome in estrogen receptor-negative (ER-) breast cancer and contains both stem cell-like and basal-like components. Thus, we examined the role of Ets-1 in NO signaling and NO-induced phenotypes in ER- human breast cancer cells. Promoter region analyses were performed on genes upregulated in inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS2) high expressing tumors for Ets-binding sites. In vitro mechanisms were examined in human basal-like breast cancer cells lines. NO signaling effects were studied using either forced NOS2 expression or the use of a chemical NO-donor, diethlylenetriamine NONOate (DETANO). Promoter region analysis of genes that are up-regulated in human ER-negative breast tumors with high NOS2 expression revealed that the Ets-binding sequence is the only common promoter element present in all of these genes, indicating that Ets-1 is the key transcriptional factor down-stream of oncogenic NOS2-signaling. Accordingly, both forced NOS2 over-expression and exposure to NO-donors resulted in significant Ets-1 transcriptional activation in ER- breast cancer cells. Functional studies showed that NO activated Ets-1 transcriptional activity via a Ras/MEK/ERK signaling pathway by a mechanism that involved Ras S-nitrosylation. RNA knock-down of Ets-1 suppressed NO-induced expression of selected basal-like breast cancer markers such as P-cadherin, S100A8, IL-8 and \u03b1\u03b2-crystallin. Additionally, Ets-1 knock-down reduced NO-mediated cellular proliferation, matrix metalloproteinase and cathepsin B activities, as well as matrigel invasion.",

Because T/HS leads to gut injury, intestinal bacterial overgrowth, and the loss of gut barrier function, the relative role of gut injury as opposed to intestinal bacterial overgrowth per se in the pathogenesis of biologically active intestinal lymph is unclear. We therefore studied whether mesenteric lymph can injure endothelial cells and/or active PMNs in an intestinal bacterial overgrowth model where there is no gut injury (monoassociation). Bacterial overgrowth was established in male rats by treating the animals with 4 days of oral antibiotics followed by administration of a nonpathogenic, streptomycin-resistant strain of Escherichia coli C25. Mesenteric lymph was then collected from rats with normal flora and from E. coli C25 monoassociated rats. Its effects were tested on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and human PMNs. As an additional control, lymph was collected from antibiotic-decontaminated rats that received antibiotics but were not colonized with E. coli C25. As compared with medium, normal flora intestinal lymph, antibiotic-decontaminated lymph, or portal plasma from the monoassociated rats, mesenteric lymph from the monoassociated rats killed HUVECs and increased the permeability of a HUVEC monolayer. In contrast to the effects on HUVECs, lymph from the monoassociated rats did not increase PMN CD11b expression or prime PMNs for an augmented respiratory burst, as compared with lymph from the rats with normal flora or from antibiotic-decontaminated rats. The effects of lymph from the monoassociated rats was not caused by bacteria, because these lymph samples were sterile.",

Moreover by providing long-range information, it could also solve haplotype phasing. However, existing long-read technologies still have several limitations that complicate their use for most research laboratories, as well as in large and/or complex genome projects.

Tips of finger and thumb contain subcutaneous fat arranged and tight compartments formed by fibrous septa which pass from skin to the periosteum of the terminal phalanx. Infection of Pulp Spaces Infection of pulp spaces also known as FELON or WHITLOW. Caused by penetrating injury from a foreign body or from fingersticks: for medical reasons (e.g. hematocrit and blood sugar determination). Staph aureus is the commonest organism to cause this infection. Swelling redness, pain, typical of cellulitis initially are presented. The pulp abscess (felon) can extend into the periosteum, around the nail bed, or proximally through the periosteum, around the nail bed, or proximally through the fibrous curtain or through the skin to the exterior over the pulp. Treatment: Incision and Drainage Web Space Infection (Collar Button Abscess) Web space infection localizes in one of the three fat filled interdigital spaces just proximal to the superficial transverse ligament at the level of metacarpophalangeal joints. Infection begins beneath palmar calluses in labourers. It may begin near the palmer surface but because skin and fascia here are less yielding it may localize to drain dorsally. Mid Palmer and Thenar Space Infection Fig: Fascial Spaces of Hand iMid palmer abscess can cause severe systemic reaction local pain and tenderness inability to move long and ring fingers because of pain and generalized swelling of hand and fingers which resemble and INFLATED GLOVE. iThenar abscess causes similar symptoms but thumb web is more swollen. The index finger is held flexed and active motion of both the index finger and thumb is impaired because of pain. Space of Parona This space is border by pronator quadratus dorsally, flexor pollicis longus laterally, flexor carpi ulnaris medially and flexor tendons on palmar aspect. Abscess of these spaces usually result from spread of infection from other parts of hand typically from purulent flexor tenosynovial infections.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.",

However, some subtype A and C viruses exhibit an unusual gene arrangement in which the first exon of rev (rev1) and the vpu gene are placed in the same open reading frame. Although this rev1-vpu gene fusion is present in a considerable fraction of HIV-1 strains, its functional significance is unknown. Examining infectious molecular clones (IMCs) of HIV-1 that encode the rev1-vpu polymorphism, we show that a fusion protein is expressed in infected cells. Due to the splicing pattern of viral mRNA, however, these same IMCs also express a regular Vpu protein, which is produced at much higher levels. To investigate the function of the fusion gene, we characterized isogenic IMC pairs differing only in their ability to express a Rev1-Vpu protein. Analysis in transfected HEK293T and infected CD4+ T cells showed that all of these viruses were equally active in known Vpu functions, such as down-modulation of CD4 or counteraction of tetherin. Furthermore, the polymorphism did not affect Vpu-mediated inhibition of NF-\u043aB activation or Rev-dependent nuclear export of incompletely spliced viral mRNAs. There was also no evidence for enhanced replication of Rev1-Vpu expressing viruses in primary PBMCs or ex vivo infected human lymphoid tissues. Finally, the frequency of HIV-1 quasispecies members that encoded a rev1-vpu fusion gene did not change in HIV-1 infected individuals over time.",

We investigated whether short-term follow-up vascular imaging adds additional information to the differential diagnosis between intracranial atherosclerotic and embolic occlusion. Acute ischemic stroke patients with symptomatic middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion on MR angiography (MRA) within 24h of symptom onset were included. Follow-up MRA was performed 5-7days after stroke onset. Stroke subtypes were independently determined at baseline and follow-up MRAs based on clinical, laboratory and imaging findings. In the 108 included patients, the most common etiologic subtype of initial stroke was intracranial large artery atherosclerosis (ICLAA) in 70 patients, followed by cardioembolism in 29 and other causes in 9. On follow-up MRA, 32 (29.6%) patients showed either significant or complete recanalization. Of these, 10 had been originally diagnosed with ICLAA, but were reclassified as a cryptogenic mechanism after follow-up MRA. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that the presence of coexisting arterial atherosclerosis (odds ratio [OR], 6.91; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.67-17.91; p<0.001); the absence of large territorial infarction (OR, 4.06; 95% CI, 1.39-11.85; p=0.010); and smoking (OR, 2.54; 95% CI, 1.028-6.29; p=0.043) were significantly associated with a final diagnosis of ICLAA.",

Hemodynamic shear stress influences the phenotype of the endothelium. Integrins and RhoA are essential components in the process that allows endothelial cells to adapt to flow. However, the signaling mechanisms that relay from integrins to RhoA are not well defined. Bovine aortic endothelial cells were subjected to laminar shear stress (10 dyne/cm(2)) for up to 6 hours. \u03b21 integrin blockade inhibited Src family kinases and p190RhoGAP tyrosine phosphorylation observed after the immediate onset of shear stress. Depletion of caveolin-1 blocked the decline in p190RhoGAP tyrosine phosphorylation observed at later points by sustaining Src family kinase activity. The manipulation of \u03b21 integrin and caveolin-1 also altered shear regulation of RhoA activity. More importantly, cells depleted of p190RhoGAP showed faulty temporal regulation of RhoA activity. Each of these treatments attenuated actin reorganization induced by flow. Similarly, stress fibers failed to form in endothelial cells exposed to enhanced blood flow in caveolin-1 knockout mice.",

IFNg activates natural killer (NK) cells, macrophages, and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), stimulates antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and induces the expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules, which leads to an increase in antigen presentation, including tumor-associated antigens (TAAs), to the immune system, and modulates the expression of certain pro-inflammatory cytokines by antigen-presenting cells (APCs).

Studies also revealed that metformin induced apoptosis in several cancer cell lines. We investigated the combinatory effect of 5-ASA and metformin on HCT-116 and Caco-2 CRC cell lines. Apoptotic markers were determined using western blotting. Expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines was determined by RT-PCR. Inflammatory transcription factors and metastatic markers were measured by ELISA. Metformin enhanced CRC cell death induced by 5-ASA through significant increase in oxidative stress and activation of apoptotic machinery. Moreover, metformin enhanced the anti-inflammatory effect of 5-ASA by decreasing the gene expression of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, COX-2 and TNF-\u03b1 and its receptors; TNF-R1 and TNF-R2. Significant inhibition of activation of NF-\u03baB and STAT3 transcription factors, and their downstream targets was also observed.

        "input": "###Question: Does insufficient ability of omental milky spots to prevent peritoneal tumor outgrowth support omentectomy in minimal residual disease?\n###Context: The greater omentum is frequently involved in the course of gastrointestinal and ovarian tumors. Therefore, common practice in surgical treatment for especially gastric and ovarian cancer includes removal of the greater omentum. Paradoxically, many immune cells, such as macrophages that accumulate in so-called milky spots, reside within the omentum and are cytotoxic against tumor cells ex vivo. Consequently, omental macrophages might play an important role in killing tumor cells, and may hereby prevent development into local peritoneal recurrences. In the present study, we therefore evaluated the role of the omentum and the clinical relevance of omentectomy in minimal residual disease (MRD). Tumor cell dissemination patterns on the omentum in a rat model were examined using DiI-labelled CC531s tumor cells. Additionally, intra peritoneal (i.p.) tumor load was investigated in rats that underwent omentectomy or sham laparotomy followed by i.p. injection of CC531s cells on day 21, which represented MRD. At 4 h post injection, tumor cells predominantly adhered on milky spots. Number of cells thereafter declined rapidly suggesting initial tumor killing functions in these specific immune aggregates. Despite initial reduction observed in milky spots, numbers of tumor cells however increased at fatty tissue stripes that border the omentum. This indicated proliferation at these locations, which corresponded to macroscopic observations of the omenta on day 21 after tumor cell injection. Omentectomy resulted in reduced intra-abdominal tumor load, which was completely attributable to the absence of the omentum, as tumor development did not differ on other sites. Even in the MRD group microscopic clusters of tumor cells located in the omentum eventually developed into macroscopic nodules.",

The intervention group included 14 older adults (3 males, 11 females, mean (SD) age: 70 (7.6) years, height: 1.6 (.11) m, mass: 76.8 (12.0) kg, BMI: 27.7(4.7)). The control group included 12 older adults (6 males, 6 females, mean (SD) age: 69.2 (6.9) years, height: 1.7 (.09) m, mass: 78.2 (10.9) kg, BMI: 25.3 (2.7)). Subjects included active older adults, including regular exercisers, but none were engaged in sports or exercises with an emphasis on speed (e.g. cycling spin classes or tennis). Stationary recumbent cycling was selected to minimize fall risk and low pedaling resistance reduced musculoskeletal and cardiovascular load. Two weekly 30-minute exercise sessions consisted of interval training in which subjects pedaled at preferred cadence and performed ten 20-s fast cadence intervals separated by 40-s of active recovery at preferred cadence. Significant Group by Time interactions (p<.05) supported a 2-s improvement in the timed up and go test and a 34% improvement in rapid isometric knee extension contractions in the exercise group but not in controls. Central neural adaptations are suggested because this lower extremity exercise program also elicited significant improvements in the untrained upper extremities of the exercise group (elbow extension RFD-SF and 9-Hole Peg Test, p<.05).",

Specifically, whether left atrial (LA) structural remodelling occurs, contributing to a decrement in atrial function and AF has not been previously determined. This study sought to determine the relationship between LA function and post-operative AF. Three hundred patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass graft surgery were monitored with intraoperative transoesophageal echocardiography to determine LA function and dimensions. Post-operative AF was monitored with continuous telemetry until hospital discharge. The relationship between clinical factors versus LA function and dimension was assessed using multi-variate logistic regression. By univariate analysis, patients who subsequently developed post-operative AF had a larger LA area and LA appendage area, and lower LA ejection fraction measured in the pre-bypass period compared to those without subsequent AF. By multivariable analysis, in addition to clinical data including age (odds ratio [OR] 1.11, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05-1.16, P<0.0001), body surface area (OR 13.31, 95% CI 1.87-94.5, P=0.0097) and white race, post-bypass atrial systolic function (atrial filling fraction 0.36, OR 2.51, 95% CI 1.03-6.13, P=0.04) and abnormal relaxation of the left ventricle (E duration 270 ms) (OR 2.89, 95% CI 1.34-6.24, P=0.0067) independently increased the risk of post-operative AF.",

In total, 1,253 T2DM patients were enrolled, including a non-metformin group (n = 616), a short-term metformin group (at least 1 week to 2 years; n=325), and a long-term metformin group (\u2265 2 years; n = 312). Their clinical and biochemical characteristics were collected and compared. After 1 year, the biochemical parameters were re-examined in 296 patients. Sex hormones were determined, and associations between CA199 and other variables were assessed. At baseline, the incidence of abnormal CA199 levels was 14.7%, 8.9%, and 4.7% in the non-metformin, short-term metformin, and long-term metformin groups, respectively. CA199 levels in females were significantly higher than in males (P < 0.01) and decreased significantly with the time of taking metformin (25.60 \u00b1 13.68 U/mL in non-metformin controls vs. 17.62 \u00b1 10.87 U/mL in the short-term group vs. 10.54 \u00b1 8.14 U/mL in the long-term group; P = 0.000). The correlation and multiple stepwise regression analysis revealed that glycosylated hemoglobin, metformin, gender, total cholesterol, and follicle-stimulating hormone were independent impact factors on CA199 concentrations (all P < 0.05). Binary logistic regression revealed that the risk of abnormal CA199 concentrations of the total population with short-term metformin or long-term metformin treatment decreased 11% (odds ratio = 0.89; P = 0.001) and 30% (odds ratio = 0.70; P = 0.000), respectively, at baseline.

The aims of the present work were to examine the in vitro activity and mechanisms of action of different antitumor drug combinations in hormone-resistant prostate cancer (HRPC) cell lines. The activity of docetaxel (Doc), cisplatin (Cis), oxaliplatin (Oxa), SN-38 and ST1481, singly or in combination, was assessed in different HRPC cell lines (PC3, parental DU145 and taxane-resistant DU145-R) by SRB test. Apoptosis was evaluated by TUNEL and ANN-V assays. Extrusion pump activity was studied by Hoechst 33342 assay, while gene expression related to drug efflux mechanisms and DNA damage repair was analyzed by RT-PCR. Doc induced a high cytocidal effect in the HRPC cells, whereas Cis, Oxa, SN-38 and ST1481 exerted prevalently cytostatic activity. Doc followed by ST1481 proved to be the most effective drug sequence among those investigated, producing an important synergistic effect (R.I. from 2.0 to 5.2) in all the tested cell lines. Moreover, this sequence induced a significant downregulation of xenobiotic extrusion pump and DNA damage repair gene expression.

We evaluated the effectiveness of an FET program for improving the embryo implantation and clinical pregnancy rates, and ultimate embryo utilization rate in infertility treatment. Patients undergoing in vitro fertilisation (IVF) cycles from January 2006 to June 2008 were enrolled, including 179 patients who had undergone the first FET cycle after controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) in which all embryos were frozen (group C1) and 1306 patients who had COH with fresh embryo transfer (ET) (group T1). Logistic regression was used to model the embryo implantation and clinical pregnancy rates based on the mother's age, numbers of oocytes retrieved, embryos transferred and high-quality embryos transferred. The embryo implantation and clinical pregnancy rates were also compared between two groups after adjusting for age, the numbers of oocytes retrieved and the numbers of embryos transferred. Logistic regression analysis confirmed that embryo implantation and clinical pregnancy rates in group C1 were both significantly higher than those in group T1 after adjusting for confounding factors (43.6% vs 29.0%, 63.1% vs 47.0%, respectively; P < 0.01).

It was hypothesized that ultrasonic guidance would increase the proportion of successful blocks, decrease block execution time, and reduce the incidence of complications such as pneumothorax and neuropathy. Eighty patients were randomized into two groups of 40, Group US (supraclavicular block guided in real time by a two-dimensional ultrasonic image, with neurostimulator confirmation of correct needle position) and Group NS (supraclavicular block using the subclavian perivascular approach, also with neurostimulator confirmation). Blocks were performed using bupivacaine 0.5% and lidocaine 2% (1:1 vol) with epinephrine 1:200000 as the anesthetic mixture. The onset of motor and sensory block for the musculocutaneous, median, radial, and ulnar nerves was evaluated over a 30 min period. At 30 min 95% of patients in Group US and 85% of patients in Group NS had a partial or complete sensory block of all nerve territories (P = 0.13) and 55% of patients in Group US and 65% of patients in Group NS had a complete block of all nerve territories (P = 0.25). Surgical anesthesia without supplementation was achieved in 85% of patients in Group US and 78% of patients in Group NS (P = 0.28). No patient in Group US and 8% of patients in Group NS required general anesthesia (P = 0.12). The quality of ulnar block was significantly inferior to the quality of block in other nerve territories in Group NS, but not in Group US; the quality of ulnar block was not significantly different between Groups NS and US. The block was performed in an average of 9.8 min in Group NS and 5.0 min in Group US (P = 0.0001). No major complication occurred in either group. We conclude that ultrasound-guided neurostimulator-confirmed supraclavicular block is more rapidly performed and provides a more complete block than supraclavicular block using anatomic landmarks and neurostimulator confirmation.",

Recently, an alternative form of the fusion protein between the EWS and Oct-4 genes, named EWS-Oct-4B, was reported in two types of epithelial tumours, a hidradenoma of the skin and a mucoepidermoid carcinoma of the salivary glands. As the N-terminal and POU domains of the EWS-Oct-4 and EWS-Oct-4B proteins are not structurally identical, we decided to investigate the functional consequences of the EWS-Oct-4B fusion. In this report, we have characterised the EWS-Oct-4B fusion protein. To investigate how the EWS-Oct-4B protein contributes to tumourigenesis in human cancers, we analysed its DNA-binding activity, subcellular localisation, transcriptional activation behaviour, and oncogenic properties. We found that this new chimeric gene encodes a nuclear protein that binds DNA with the same sequence specificity as the parental Oct-4 protein or the fusion EWS-Oct-4 protein. We show that the nuclear localisation signal of EWS-Oct-4B is dependent on the POU DNA-binding domain, and we identified a cluster of basic amino acids, (269)RKRKR(273), in the POU domain that specifically mediates the nuclear localisation of EWS-Oct-4B. Comparison of the properties of EWS-Oct-4B and EWS-Oct-4 indicated that EWS-Oct-4B is a less-potent transcriptional activator of a reporter construct carrying the Oct-4-binding sites. Deletion analysis of the functional domains of EWS-Oct-4B revealed that the EWS N-terminal domain (NTD)(B), POU, and C-terminal domain (CTD) are necessary for its full transactivation potential. Despite its reduced activity as a transcriptional activator, EWS-Oct-4B regulated the expression of fgf-4 (fibroblast growth factor-4) and nanog, which are potent mitogens, as well as of Oct-4 downstream target genes, the promoters of which contain potential Oct-4-binding sites. Finally, ectopic expression of EWS-Oct-4B in Oct-4-null ZHBTc4 ES cells resulted in increased tumourigenic growth potential in nude mice.",

In this study, we investigated the role of ceramide metabolism by GCS in the regulation of imatinib-induced apoptosis in drug-sensitive and drug-resistant K562 and K562/IMA-0.2 and K562/IMA-1 human CML cells, which exhibit about 2.3- and 19-fold imatinib resistance, respectively. Cytotoxic effects of PDMP and imatinib were determined by XTT cell proliferation assay. Expression levels of GCS were determined by RT-PCR and western blot. Intracellular ceramide levels were determined by LC-MS. Cell viability analyses was conducted by Trypan blue dye exclusion assay. Cell cycle and apoptosis analyses were examined by flow cytometry. We first showed that mRNA and protein levels of GCS are increased in drug-resistant K562/IMA as compared to sensitive K562 cells. Next, forced expression of GCS in sensitive K562 cells conferred resistance to imatinib-induced apoptosis.

The viability and proliferation of human NSCLC cell lines A549 and H1299 were assessed in vitro. Anti-tumor action was also evaluated in A549 xenograft nude mice treated with DEX (2 or 4 mg\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7d(-1), ig) or the positive control tamoxifen (50 mg\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7d(-1), ig) for 32 d.

In a prospective study, 25 patients with glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) values above 8.0% were randomized into 2 groups. Both groups, a glucose-only testing group (14 patients with an initial mean HbA1c of 9.4 +/- 0.9%) and a combined glucose plus fructosamine testing group (11 patients with an initial mean HbA1c of 9.2 +/- 0.7%), received therapeutic intervention at the time of randomization. Both groups were instructed to perform blood glucose testing up to four times per day. The combined glucose plus fructosamine testing group was also instructed to perform weekly fructosamine testing in addition to the glucose testing and to telephone the investigator if their home-testing fructosamine value exceeded 350 mmol/L (approximately equivalent to HbA1c of 7.8%), whereupon the investigator implemented further interventions. Both groups returned in 3 months, at which time HbA1c testing was repeated in order to determine whether glycemic control had changed. The study results after 3 months showed that the HbA1c values in the combined glucose plus fructosamine testing group decreased from 9.2 +/- 0.7% to 8.0 +/- 0.5% (P<0.0001). In contrast, the HbA1c values in the glucose-only testing group declined from 9.4 +/- 0.9% to 9.1 +/- 1.3%, a difference that was not significant.",

Here, we introduce tree-based tests of alignment accuracy, which not only use large and representative samples of real biological data, but also enable the evaluation of the effect of gap placement on phylogenetic inference. We show that (i) the current belief that consistency-based alignments outperform scoring matrix-based alignments is misguided; (ii) gaps carry substantial phylogenetic signal, but are poorly exploited by most alignment and tree building programs; (iii) even so, excluding gaps and variable regions is detrimental; (iv) disagreement among alignment programs says little about the accuracy of resulting trees.",

Three isoforms of PPARs have been identified with different tissue distribution and biological functions. Although the pharmacology of each receptor is well studied, the physiological effect of simultaneous activation of PPARalpha, gamma and delta is only starting to emerge. We sought to determine the biological effects of a novel PPAR pan activator and elucidate the physiological mechanisms involved. Ob/ob, diet-induced obese (DIO) or PPARalpha knockout mice were administered a novel agonist that activates all PPARs to various degrees to determine the effect on body weight, body composition, food intake and energy expenditure. In addition, serum parameters including glucose, insulin, triglycerides and ketone bodies as well as tissue acylcarnitine were evaluated. The effect of the novel agonist on liver and skeletal muscle histopathology was also studied. We report that simultaneous activation of all PPARs resulted in substantial weight loss in ob/ob and DIO mice. Consistent with known PPAR pharmacology, we observed that agonist treatment increased lipid oxidation, although appetite suppression was mainly responsible for the weight loss.

        "input": "###Question: Does pheochromocytoma increase risk in laparoscopic adrenalectomy?\n###Context: Laparoscopic adrenalectomy (LA) has become the standard approach to an adrenal mass. This technique provides for decreased convalescence, less postoperative pain, and improved cosmesis. The use of LA for pheochromocytoma (PHE) has been questioned due to concerns of increased morbidity and negative hemodynamic sequelae. This study aimed to compare the outcomes of LA for PHE with the results of LA for other adrenal pathologies. A retrospective chart review was performed for an 11-year period from July 1997 to December 2008. Patient demographics, perioperative data, and outcomes were recorded. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 16.0. Statistical significance was defined as a p value less than 0.05. A total of 102 LA procedures were completed for 95 patients. The data for 33 PHE cases were compared with the data for 69 non-PHE cases (26 adenomas, 14 aldosteronomas, 5 cortisol-secreting tumors, 5 multinodular hyperplasias, and 19 other disorders). Five LA procedures were converted to open surgery. Four of these conversions involved patients with PHE (p = 0.03). There was no difference in the mean estimated blood loss (p = 0.2) or operative time (p = 0.1) between the two groups. The frequency of intraoperative hypertension and hypotension did not differ between the PHE and non-PHE cohorts. The complication rate was 7.5% for the PHE group and 6.9% for the non-PHE group (p = 0.7). The patients with PHE had a longer postoperative hospital stay (3.6 vs 2.3 days; p < 0.001) and overall hospital stay (4.9 vs 2.6 days; p < 0.001). Time in the intensive care unit (1.1 vs 0.1 days; p < 0.001) and time until oral intake (1.5 vs 1.0 days; p = 0.02) also were increased in the PHE population. There was one death in the PHE group secondary to congestive heart failure.",

Basilar artery (endothelium-denuded) was isolated for tension measurement and Western blots. Enzymically dissociated single myocytes from basilar arteries were used for patch-clamp electrophysiological and confocal microscopic studies. Under resting tension, 5-HT elicited a concentration-dependent tension development with a greater sensitivity (with unchanged maximum tension development) in SHR compared with WKY (EC(50) : 28.4 \u00b1 4.1 nM vs. 98.2 \u00b1 9.4 nM). The exaggerated component of 5-HT-induced tension development in SHR was eradicated by polyethylene glycol-catalase, clorgyline and citalopram whereas exogenously applied H\u2082O\u2082 enhanced the 5-HT-elicited tension development in WKY. A greater protein expression of MAO-A was detected in basilar arteries from SHR than in those from WKY. In single myocytes and the entire basilar artery, 5-HT generated (clorgyline-sensitive) a greater amount of H\u2082O\u2082 in SHR compared with WKY. Whole-cell iberiotoxin-sensitive Ca(2+) -activated K(+) (BK(Ca) ) amplitude measured in myocytes of SHR was approximately threefold greater than that in WKY (at +60 mV: 7.61 \u00b1 0.89 pA\u00b7pF(-1) vs. 2.61 \u00b1 0.66 pA\u00b7pF(-1) ). In SHR myocytes, 5-HT caused a greater inhibition (clorgyline-, polyethylene glycol-catalase- and reduced glutathione-sensitive) of BK(Ca) amplitude than in those from WKY.",

We used data from the Nord-Tr\u00f8ndelag Health Study (HUNT) (n=64,931) of 1995-1997. ACR (mg/mmol) was measured in three urine samples from all diabetic patients (n=1525) and from 5% of the non-diabetic study population (n=2104). We calculated the geometric means and 95% confidence intervals (CI) using a general linear model. The unadjusted mean ACR in LADA was similar to that in T2D (1.45, CI: 1.23-1.71 vs 1.41, CI: 1.33-1.49, respectively) but was significantly higher than those in T1D (0.99, CI: 0.83-1.19; P=0.002) and non-diabetics (0.72, CI: 0.69-0.74; P<0.001).

We compared the diagnostic yield, therapeutic yield, and complications of antegrade and retrograde enteroscopy. We performed a retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database of patients who underwent small-bowel enteroscopy at our institution from January 2008 to August 2009. All enteroscopies were performed using single-balloon enteroscopy (SBE), double-balloon enteroscopy (DBE), or spiral enteroscopy (SE). A total of 250 enteroscopies were performed; 182 were antegrade (91 SBE, 52 DBE, and 39 SE) and 68 were retrograde (23 SBE, 37 DBE, and 8 SE). The mean age of the patients was 61.5 \u00b1 15.8 years. The most common indication for small-bowel endoscopy was obscure gastrointestinal bleeding (n = 83).
